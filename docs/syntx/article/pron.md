# Pronominal Uses of the Article

In a few highly specific uses the article has a pronominal function (i.e. serves as a noun phrase by itself, [REF]).

1. The article can be used as a *3rd person object* instead of `se`, `sa` (compare with English *it* and *that*):

	> `vá caris i` [PE22/162]. *He is not to do* ***this***.

2. The article might be used as a relative pronoun in a *common case*:

	> `i·Eru i or ilye mahalmar ea tennoio` [UT/305] *The One* ***who*** *is above all thrones for ever*.

	> `Átaremma i ea h·an Ea` [VT43/12] *Our Father* ***who*** *art in Heaven*.

3. Or as a head of autonomous relative clause (for details, [REF]):

	> `lá carita i hamil mára alasaila ná` [PE22/154]. *Not to do* ***what you judge good*** *would be unwise*.
	
!!! note
	The article in these functions can sometimes be confused with conjunction or plural animate relative pronoun `i`.
