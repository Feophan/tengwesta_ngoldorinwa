# Relative Position of Article, Head and Modifiers in a Noun Phrase

## Attributive and Predicative Position

When the head of a noun phrase is modified by the article and one or more other modifiers (adjectives, pronouns, participles, [REF]), two different orderings of article, head and modifier can be distinguished:

+ so-called **attributive position** (the modifier is between the article and the head): `i mára nér` *the good man*;
+ so-called **predicative position** (the modifier is after the head, or before the article): `i·nér mára`, `mára i·nér` *the man, being good, …* (or: *the man is good*).

!!! note
	In poetry the distinction is not strict, and head-modifier order can be attributive:
	
	> `i·fairi néce ringa súmaryasse` [MC/221]. *The pale phantoms in her cold bosom*.
	
<a name="28-15"></a>
!!! tip
	The general difference between attributive and predicative position may be described in the following way:
	
	+ a modifier in attributive position typically serve to identify the referent of the head noun (cf. e.g. En. *the good man*, as opposed to any other man);
	
	+ a modifier in predicative position is not used to identify the referent. Rather, adjectives and participles in predicative position say something about the condition the referent is in (cf. En. *I drink my coffee* ***black***, *They found the premises* ***deserted***).
	
The predicative position is always used for predicative complements with linking verbs [REF].

However, there are various kinds of modifiers for which the distinction between the
positions outlined above does not hold. These are treated below.

## Attributive Genitives I and II

Most **attributive genitives** [REF] can occur in both positions:

`valaron arcanwar`, `arcanwar valaron` *the trones of the Valar*.

The difference between the two constructions appears to be that in attributive position, the genitive I is presented as (more) vital for the identification of the head noun (for example, when the Valar are contrasted with another people, the attributive position will be used). But often the distinction is slight.

In attributive position whether the head is definite of indefinite is undetermined, and the article modifies only the genitive:

`i·túrin i·cormaron`, `i·cormaron túrin` *the Lord of the Rings*

The rules of attributive genitive I above apply to attributive genitive II as well. However, it also can be treated as a quasi-adjective (for details, [REF]), not modified by the article, which then stands for the whole noun phrase:

> `i·tyulma ciryava` [PE21/80]. *The mast of the ship*

> `lírinen ómo i aire táríva` [PE17/76]. *By the song of the voice of the holy queen*.

!!! note
	In each of these uses, modifiers in 'predicative' position actually do not have predicative function (for predicative function, [REF] and [28.15](#28-15)). The terminology is therefore somewhat misleading, and should be taken to refer merely to word order.
