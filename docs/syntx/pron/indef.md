# Indefinite Pronouns[^1]

The indefinite pronouns refer to someone or something that is not immediately identifiable. They can appear in the varying contexts, some of which include:

+ When **the speaker does not wish to reveal**, or pay attention to, the identity of a specific individual:
	
	> `námo tule, intya man` *Someone came, guess who*.

+ When referring to individuals whose specific identity is **unknown** or **irrelevant**:

	> `hlassen ma, mal ú istan manima` *I heard something, but I don't know of what sort*. 

+ When referring to something **non-specific** or **non-existing**:

	> `neve ma h·ecsa, mecin` *Please, try something else*[^2].

+ In **comparison**, **condition** and **possibility**:

	> `náse halda lá aiquen` *He is taller than anyone*;
	
	> `cé cenil aiquen, quetá nin` *Shall you see anyone, tell me*;
	
	> `lertal mique aiquen` *You may kiss anyone*.
	
+ In **negation** and **polar question**:

	> `ú cennen úquen` *I haven't seen anyone*;
	
	> `ú novin i úquen tuluva` *I don't think anyone will come*;
	
	> `ma úquen quente lyen úqua pá·sa?` *Has anyone told you anything about that?*
