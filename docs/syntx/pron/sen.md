# Sentential Pronouns

While personal pronouns refer to specific words or noun phrases (or constructions operating as noun phrases), sometimes we might need to mention a larger segment of a
conversation instead, a clause or a sequence of clauses. Alongside demonstrative pronouns, Quenya has two additional **sentential pronouns** for this case — subjective `ha` and objective `sa` (similar to `sana`, &rarr;29.14):

> `yára Túro mante ilqua masta, ha mé·ne úmactale` [PE22/119]. *Old Turo ate all the bread, that was a nuisance to us*. Pronoun `ha` means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'.

> `yára Túro mante ilqua masta. Mé·láner fasta sa` [modified; PE22/119]. *Old Turo ate all the bread. We were not pleased with that*. Pronoun `sa` means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'.
