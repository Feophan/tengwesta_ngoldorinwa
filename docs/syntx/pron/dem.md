# Demonstrative Pronouns

## Pointing Outside or Inside the Text

Demonstratives have a pointing or **deictic** function. They may either point to someone/thing in the world **outside the text**, or to a single word or larger segment of **the text itself**.

> `Telperinquar Erciandello tence sine tenguar` [translated; LotR/305]. *Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs*. `sine` refers to the signs actually present on the door, &rarr; we might imagine Celebrimbor pointing at them.

> `lende tanna Nieliccelis, sana wende nieninquea` [PE16/96]. *Thither came little Niéle, that maiden like a snowdrop*. The pronoun refers to element in the text, anaphorically to Niéle.

When pointing outside of the text, demonstratives distinguish between proximal `sina` *this by me*, medial `tana` *that by you*, and distal `enta` *yonder*:

+ `sina` refers to something immediately near to the speaker (physically or mentally);
+ `tana` refers to something within the reach of the speaker and/or addressee (physically or mentally), but not specifically near to the speaker;
+ `enta` refers to something beyond the reach of the speaker and addressee (physically or mentally).

When a demonstrative refers to an element in the text itself it may refer backward to something introduced before (anaphoric use) or point forward in the text to something about to be introduced (cataphoric use):

+ `sina` or `enta` normally serve to announce something that will follow immediately, or refer to something prominent in the speaker's mind;
+ `sana` is used most often to refer to something mentioned previously;
+ to refer to something which has not been mentioned for a while (or to pick up something which was mentioned before a form of `sana` or `sina` 'intervened') a form of `yana` *former* must be used instead.

## Further Particulars

Forms of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs usually have short and long
forms (&rarr;7.18). The long demonstrative nearly always carries heavier stress:

> `sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambarmetta` [LotR/967]. *In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world*.

> `umbe nin i hríve nauva urra si loa` [PE22/168]. *I have a feeling that winter will be bad this year*.
