# Quantifiers

### ilya

The quantifier `ilya` in the singular means *each, every*. In the plural, it means *all*:

> `ilya osto` *each/every city* (sometimes: *an entire city*)
	
> `ilye ostor` *all the cities*

The corresponding **universal pronouns** are `ilquen` *everyone* and `illi` *all*. 

### quana[^1]

The quantifier `quana` means *whole, entire*:

> `tirá quana tama` *Look at the entire matter*.

### er

`er` means *by itself, alone, the only*:

> `er hinyan na anta i·ríe` *To my only child shall be given a crown*.
	
### enta and jana

The basic meaning of `enta` is *other (out of many)*, stressing **similarity**. The basic meaning of `jana` is *other (than something else)*, stressing **difference**:

> `ólamar ar ente lámar` *consonants and other sounds*;
	
> `ólamar jane lámar lá ómar` *connsonants are different sounds than vowels*.
	
## Indefinite Marker as Quantifier

In many cases the indefinite marker (&rarr;4.7) can be translated to English with quantifier *some*. When it stands with the article it means *many*:

> `i·falmalinnar imbe met` [LotR/377]. *Upon the many foaming waves between us two*.

When modified by a quantifier `nótima` it means *(a) few*:

> `cennen nótime eldali` [PE22/155]. *I saw a few Elves*.
