# Personal Pronouns

## Accented and Non-Accented Personal Pronouns[^1]

Personal pronouns are used only pronominally (&rarr;26.22-3). They are either accented (**stressed** and **emphatic**) or non-accented (for details, &rarr;7.1-2): to an extent, this distinction corresponds to a contrastive and a non-contrastive function. When describing the subject, and no (contrastive) emphasis is needed, the personal endings of the verb suffice. The unaccented pronouns are then only used in **oblique cases**.

> `cé tulis, tanome nauvan` [VT49/19]. *If he comes, I will be there*. No emphasis on the subject.

> `nai lye hiruva airea Amanar` [AUCT-LET/1963-12-18]. *May thee find a blessed Yule*. Unaccented pronoun in oblique case. 

Contrast signals to a listener that the utterance should be taken as one of several alternatives. Depending on their importance, contrast might be **exhaustive** or **uncertain**.

**Exhaustive** is contrast where all relevant alternatives are covered, either explicitly in several clauses, or implicitly with entity present in the context:

> `inye túle, apa isse úne` [&mdash;]. ***I*** *came, but* ***HE*** *didn’t*. All other alternatives (e.g. me not coming, or him coming) are explicitly dismissed.

> `nai elye hiruva` [LotR/378]. *Maybe* ***THOU*** *shalt find it*. Galadriel implicitly contrasts herself to Frodo, expecting never to come back to Valimar herself.

Alternatives of exhaustive contrast are generally mutually exclusive.

With an **uncertain** contrast the speaker is only making a claim about the referent of the pronoun and leaves it open whether this claim should or should not apply to the other referents relevant in the discourse:

> `cé tulis, ní nauva tanome` [VT49/19]. *If he comes,* ***I*** *will be there*. Whether anyone else will be there is left on the table.

Unlike alternatives of exhaustive contrast, here they don’t need to be exclusive.

Another factor is **focality**. Some of the typical cases include clefts, answers to wh-questions, comparative constructions, focus constructions, etc:

> `melinye sé apa lá hé` [VT49/15]. *I love* ***HIM****, but not* ***HIM***. The answer to a question: '**Whom** do you love?'

Main purpose of an accented pronoun in such position is to *identify* a referent as one of several alternatives, or to *exhaust* the set by dismissing all other alternatives:

> `aistana elye imíca nísi` [VT43/28]. *Blessed art* ***THOU*** *amongst women*. Exhaustive pronoun implies that only Mary is considered.

!!! tip
	The difference between stressed and emphatic pronouns then comes to differentiate between these two classes of contrast. Exhaustive contrast is denoted by emphatic pronouns, often appended in translation to English with *only* or *even*. Stressed pronouns are used then for weak, identifying contrast. However, this distinction does not always hold.
	
## First and Second Person

First-person pronoun refers to a speaker, and in addition to number and accent distinguishes clusivity: listener can be either involved (**inclusive** 'we') or specifically excepted (**exclusive** 'we') from the context.

|           	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-----------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg.       	| ni         	| ní       	| inye     	|
| pl. incl. 	| we         	| wé       	| elwe     	|
| pl. excl. 	| me         	| mé       	| elme     	|
| d. incl.  	| wet        	| wét      	| inque    	|
| d. excl.  	| met        	| mét      	| emme     	|

 Second-person pronoun refers to a listener, and has different levels of formality:
 
|           	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-----------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg. familiar 	| tye         	| tyé      	| itye     	|
| sg. formal 	| lye         	| lyé      	| elye     	|
| pl.		 	| le         	| lé       	| elde     	|
| d.		  	| lyet        	| lyét     	| este     	|

!!! note
	In colloquial speech, particularly of Men, *plural exclusive* form was sometimes used for first person plural in general. This was considered incorrect by Ngoldor[^2].   

	Later, except for colloquial speech, familiar `tye` was eventually displaced by `lye`. To denote respect `tar` *sir, madam* could be used instead[^3].
	
## Third and Fourth Person

Third- and fourth-person pronouns refer to an entity other than a speaker or a listener. To alleviate the ambiguity between several actors within the same phrase, first actor is marked as third-person, and the following as fourth:

> `sé ringane hé, ar hé runce` [modified VT49/15]. *He struck* ***him****, and* ***he*** *fled*. There is no ambiguity, as there would be in English.

Third and fourth person distinguish **animate** and **inanimate** gender. Distinction is semantic: animates are noun capable to act on their own volition (including trees and plants), and inanimates are the rest (including abstract concepts).

+ third-person pronouns:

|             	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-------------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg. anim.   	| se         	| sé       	| isse     	|
| pl. anim.   	| te         	| té       	| inte     	|
| sg. inanim. 	| sa         	| sá       	| issa     	|
| pl. inanim. 	| ta(i)      	| tá       	| inta     	|
| d.          	| tu         	| tú       	| itte     	|

+ fourth-person pronouns (only singular):

|             	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-------------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg. anim.   	| je         	| jé       	| ecse     	|
| sg. inanim. 	| ja         	| já       	| ecsa     	|
