# Reciprocal Pronouns

The **reciprocal** construction expresses the idea that two or more persons are **simultaneously involved** in one and the same action, like English *each other*, *one another*.

Reciprocal actions can be expressed in Quenya by the preverb `o·` *with* (e.g. `o·mennente` *they met each other*), by the personal pronoun (`te palpanente` *they hit each other*) and by the repetition of cognates:

> `má sove má`. *Hands wash each other*.
