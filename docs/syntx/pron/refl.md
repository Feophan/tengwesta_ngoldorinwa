# Reflexive Pronouns and Other Reflexive Expressions

## Introduction; Pronouns Used as Reflexives; Direct and Indirect Reflexives[^1]

**Reflexivity** is the phenomenon whereby a pronoun is used to 'reflect' (i.e. refer back or forwards to) another constituent of the sentence or clause, nearly always the subject:

> `an cé mo querne immo númenna` [draft VT49/6]. *For if one turned oneself westward*.

A distinction is made between:

+ **direct reflexivity**: pronouns which refer back to an element within the same clause/construction;
+ **indirect reflexivity**: pronouns in a subordinate construction (subordinate clauses, infinitive or participle constructions), which refer back to an element in the main/matrix clause (for subordination, &rarr;39.2, 39.5):

> `Elerondo quente insen`. *Elrond said to himself*. Direct reflexive: `inse` is the indirect object of `quente`, and refers to its subject.

> `Elerondo hlasse sa Elessar quente sen`. *Elrond heard what Aragorn told him*. Indirect reflexive: `se` refers back to the subject of `hlasse`, but syntactically is a part of the dependent clause.

!!! tip
	Like English, Quenya doesn't use reflexive pronouns with **introverted actions**[^3] unlike many other languages, preferring bare intransitive verbs. Typical extroverted verbs are transitive verbs like 'kill', 'hate', 'criticize', 'see', 'attack', and typical introverted verbs are verbs like 'wash', 'shave', 'dress', 'defend'.
	
	Some introverted actions might be expressed by the mediopassive voice, but only with certain verbs ('verbs of grooming', &rarr;35.11). Extroverted actions always require a pronoun.

The following pronouns are used in reflexive constructions:

+ the reflexive pronoun (`imne`, `imule`, `inse`, etc., &rarr;7.3);
+ (oblique cases of) the personal pronoun (`ni`, `lye`, `se`, etc., &rarr;7.2);
+ reflexive inflection.

!!! note
	A distinction should thus be maintained between 'reflexive pronouns' (a morphological category, referring to a specific type of pronoun, `inse`, etc.) and 'pronouns used in reflexive constructions' (a syntactic phenomenon). While reflexive pronouns always express reflexivity, reflexivity is not always necessarily marked by the use of a reflexive pronoun.

## Pronouns Used as Direct and Indirect Reflexives

### Obviation

In many (or perhaps most) languages, nonsubject anaphoric personal pronouns
are **obviative**, i.e. they cannot be coreferential with a coargument: 

> The dogs<sub>1</sub> bit them<sub>2/\*1</sub>.

Quenya, however, has three types of third person anaphoric pronouns: an obviative nonreflexive pronoun `hye`, a nonobviative nonreflexive pronun `se`, and a reflexive pronoun `inse`:[^2]

> `Zindacollo`<sub>1</sub> `tatalla` `hye`<sub>2</sub>/`se`<sub>1/2</sub>/`inse`<sub>1</sub>. *Thingol admires him*<sub>2</sub>/*him(self)*<sub>1/2</sub>/*himself*<sub>1</sub>.

Note how the use of `se` can be ambiguous.

### Direct Reflexivity

In the direct reflexive use, the **reflexive pronoun** is normally required, particularly for emphasis (&rarr;29.2-5) or to distinguish from reciprocal use of personal pronoun (&rarr;29.14).

> `Arwen cenne inse i·cilintilasse`. *Arwen saw herself in the mirror*.  

However, **personal pronouns** can be used as direct reflexives, especially in the first and second person, and in poetry much more freely than in prose.

> `ni·cúven`. *I hid myself*.

If the third person is **implicit**, verb receives a reflexive ending:

> `melisse`/`melitte` [VT49/21]. *He loves himself*/*they love themselves*.

### Indirect Reflexivity

In indirect reflexive context, the nonobviative nonrelexive pronouns are used (reflexive pronoun is **bound locally**):

`Arcimbelenna leltaniéla h·oraneltet roccor téna ta rimba ve cárima tulta`. *They*<sub>1</sub> *sent to Rivendell and asked that they*<sub>2</sub> *send them*<sub>1/3</sub> *as many horses as possible*. `téna` refers back to the subject of `h·oraneltet` (1), though obviative interpretation (3) is possible. `inte` could only refer to the subject of infinitive clause (2).
