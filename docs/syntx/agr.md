# Agreement

## Subject – Finite Verb ## {: #sfv }

### Basic Rule

!!! important "Rule"
	**Rule 1**: a finite verb agrees in **number** and **person** with its **subject**.<br>	
	**Rule 2**: within a clause, **overt argument** noun phrases never appear with concording **personal endings**[^sfv1]:

`i·cirya círa` *the ship is setting out* (overt third person singular)<br>
`i·ciryar círar` *the ships are setting out* (overt third person plural)<br>
`círante` *they (ships) are setting out* (implicit third person plural)
{: .ref .hide #27}

### Exceptions

When the verb has an **covert object** and a **overt subject**, the objective inflection displaces agreement in number:
{: .ref #27}

+ `sív' emme apsenet tien i úcarir emmen` [VT43/12]. *As we forgive those who trespass against us*.
{: .exp}
	
When a subject is **neutral group plural**, the verb can be singular:
{: .ref #27}

+ `i·oromandi tanna lende` [PE16/96]. *The wood-spirits came thither*.
{: .exp}

The plural form of the verb may, however, be used to emphasize that the subject consists of various individual members:

+ `Valar ar Maiar fantaner nassentar fanainen` [PE17/174]. *Valar and Maiar cloaked their true-being in veils*.
{: .exp}

When there are **multiple subjects**, the verb will normally be plural. Sometimes, however, especially when the verb precedes a first singular subject, it may be singular:
{: .ref #27}

> `sanome tarne Olórin, Aracorno, Eomer, Imrahil` [PE17/71]. *There stood Gandalf, Aragorn, Eomer and Imrahil*.<br>
	`sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta` [LotR/967]. *In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world*.

The singular form may also be used with complex conjunctions, for examples `ú ... ú`[^sfv2] *neither … nor*, particularly if nouns belong to the same grammatical gender:
{: .ref #27}

+ `ú luime ú lúme hora úquen` (translation from GN: GL/53). *Neither flood nor time waits for anyone*.
{: .exp}

The verb may agree in number with the subject in meaning rather than in grammatical form: this is called the **notional agreement** or **synesis**; for example, when the subject is singular but refers to a collective, the verb may be plural in form:
{: .ref #27}

+ `lie tatallaner i·már ampanaina` [VT49/43]. *While it was being built people marveled at the house*. `tatallaner` agrees with singular `lie` in plural.
{: .exp}

[^sfv1]: The only exception for the rule, `esse úpa nás` seems to be an echo of archaic word order. Whether it actually belongs to Quenya proper is debatable.
[^sfv2]: Attested only in GN.

*[GN]: Gnomish

## Head – Modifier (in Noun Phrases); Predicative Modifiers and Complements

### Basic Rule ### {: #hmr }

!!! important "Rule"
	**Rule 1**: an adjective, passive participle or adnominal pronoun agrees in **case** and **number** with the head it modifies.<br>
	**Rule 2**: only one eligible component of a noun phrase receives the case inflection:

`i·saila nér` *the wise man* (com. sg.)<br>
`i·saile neri` *the wise men* (com. pl.)<br>
`i·saile nerin` *to the wise men* (dat. pl. head-last)<br>
`i·neri sailain` *to the wise men* (dat. pl. head-first)
{: .ref .hide #27}

!!! note
	Only some numerals decline: for indeclinable numerals, &rarr;@@.
	
	Other types of modifiers do not agree with their head, particularly attributive genitive I, adverbs, cardinal numerals and prepositional phrases. For examples, &rarr;[26.17](sen.md#26.17).
	
### Exceptions

Modifier might not agree with its following head in **adverbial case**:
{: .ref #27}

+ `ono alye eterúna me illume ilya racsellor` [VT44/9]. *But deliver us always from all dangers*. `ilya` doesn’t agree with `racsellor` in number.
{: .exp}
+ `man tiruva cirya ondolisse morne` [MC/222]. *Who shall heed a ship on the dark rocks?* `morne` agrees with `ondolisse` in number.
{: .exp}

Note that if *modifier* receives adverbial case inflection instead, it **agrees in number** with its head as usual:

+ `anar púrea ticta acsor ilcalannar` [MC/222]. *The sun blinking on the gleaming bones*.
{: .exp}

Modifier might not agree with its following head, if the noun phrase as a whole is a modifier in another noun phrase:
{: .ref #27}

+ `aran linta ciryalíva` [PE17/147]. *King of Swift Ships*.
{: .exp}

A demonstrative pronoun or a qualifier which serves as subject to a linking verb and predicative noun ('this is X') may either agree with that noun, or appear in the neuter:
{: .ref #27}

+ `ilya sí maller raicar` [LR/47]. *Now all roads are bent*.
{: .exp}

A noun in genitive II case usually behaves as an adjective, but might not agree with a head inflected for case or, in later use, if it takes on the role of genitive:
{: .ref #27}

+ `linte yuldar lisse miruvóreva` [RGEO/58]. *Swift draughts of the sweet mead*. `miruvóreva` doesn’t agree with `yuldar` in number.
{: .exp}

## Antecedent &mdash; Relative Pronoun

### Basic Rule

!!! important "Rule"
	**Rule 1**: a relative pronoun agrees in number and gender with its antecedent, but its case is determined by its syntactical function in the relative clause (for details, &rarr;@@):

`i·cirya ya círa` *the ship which is putting out to sea* (sg. inanim. as the antecedent, com. as subject in the relative clause).<br>
`i·nér yen antanes miquelis` *the man to who she gave a kiss* (sg. anim. as the antecedent, dat. as indirect object in the relative clause).
{: .ref .hide #27}

### Exceptions

The sense construction (&rarr;[27.6](#27.6)) is possible with relative pronouns.
{: .ref #27}

For other exceptions, especially 'relative repulsion', &rarr;@@.
{: .ref #27}

## Apposition ## {: #app }

An appositive (&rarr;[26.21](sen.md#app)) **agrees in case** with the word it belongs to, but has **its own number and gender**:
{: .ref #27}

+ `Elainen tárin Periandion ar meldenya anyáran` [VT49/40]. *To Elaine, queen of Hobbits and my very old friend*.
{: .exp}

An appositive to a possessive clitic stands in the case of the host:
{: .ref #27}

+ `coarya Olwe` [WJ/369]. *The house of him, Olwe*.
{: .exp}
+ `tintilar i·eleni ómaryo lírinen aire-tário` [RGEO/59]. *The stars twinkle in her voice’s song, of the holy queen*.
{: .exp}

	Fix the case of apposition to a sentence and reference it in case chapter.
