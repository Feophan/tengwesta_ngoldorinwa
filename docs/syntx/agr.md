# Agreement

## Subject – Finite Verb {: id=sfv }

### Basic Rule

>[!RULE] Rule 1
>A finite verb agrees in **number** and **person** with its **subject**.

 >[!RULE] Rule 2
 >Within a clause, **overt argument** noun phrases never appear with concording **personal endings**[^sfv1]

+ `i·cirya círa` *the ship is setting out* (overt third person singular)
+ `i·ciryar círar` *the ships are setting out* (overt third person plural)
+ `círante` *they (ships) are setting out* (implicit third person plural)

### Exceptions

When the verb has an **covert object** and a **overt subject**, the objective inflection displaces agreement in number:

1. `sív' emme apsenet tien i úcarir emmen` \[VT43/12\]. *As we forgive those who trespass against us*.

When a subject is **neutral group plural**, the verb can be singular:

1. `i·oromandi tanna lende` \[PE16/96\]. *The wood-spirits came thither*.

The plural form of the verb may, however, be used to emphasize that the subject consists of various individual members:

1. `Valar ar Maiar fantaner nassentar fanainen` \[PE17/174\]. *Valar and Maiar cloaked their true-being in veils*.

When there are **multiple subjects**, the verb will normally be plural. Sometimes, however, especially when the verb precedes a first singular subject, it may be singular:

1. `sanome tarne Olórin, Aracorno, Eomer, Imrahil` \[PE17/71\]. *There stood Gandalf, Aragorn, Eomer and Imrahil*.
2. `sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta` \[LotR/967\]. *In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world*.

The singular form may also be used with complex conjunctions, for examples `ú ... ú`[^sfv2] *neither … nor*, particularly if nouns belong to the same grammatical gender:

1. `ú luime ú lúme hora úquen` (translation from GN: GL/53). *Neither flood nor time waits for anyone*.

The verb may agree in number with the subject in meaning rather than in grammatical form: this is called the **notional agreement** or **synesis**; for example, when the subject is singular but refers to a collective, the verb may be plural in form:

1. `lie tatallaner i·már ampanaina` \[VT49/43\]. *While it was being built people marveled at the house*. `tatallaner` agrees with singular `lie` in plural.

[^sfv1]: The only exception for the rule, `esse úpa nás` seems to be an echo of archaic word order. Whether it actually belongs to Quenya proper is debatable.
[^sfv2]: Attested only in GN.

## Head – Modifier (in Noun Phrases); Predicative Modifiers and Complements

### Basic Rule {: id=hmr }

>[!RULE] Rule 1
>An adjective, passive participle or adnominal pronoun agrees in **case** and **number** with the head it modifies.

>[!RULE] Rule 2
>Only one eligible component of a noun phrase receives the case inflection.

+ `i·saila nér` *the wise man* (com. sg.)
+ `i·saile neri` *the wise men* (com. pl.)
+ `i·saile nerin` *to the wise men* (dat. pl. head-last)
+ `i·neri sailain` *to the wise men* (dat. pl. head-first)

>[!NOTE]
>Only some numerals decline: for indeclinable numerals, →@@.
>
>Other types of modifiers do not agree with their head, particularly attributive genitive I, adverbs, cardinal numerals and prepositional phrases. For examples, →[26.17](sen.md#26.17).

### Exceptions

Modifier might not agree with its following head in **adverbial case**:

1. `ono alye eterúna me illume ilya racsellor` \[VT44/9\]. *But deliver us always from all dangers*. `ilya` doesn’t agree with `racsellor` in number.
2. `man tiruva cirya ondolisse morne` \[MC/222\]. *Who shall heed a ship on the dark rocks?* `morne` agrees with `ondolisse` in number.

Note that if *modifier* receives adverbial case inflection instead, it **agrees in number** with its head as usual:

1. `anar púrea ticta acsor ilcalannar` \[MC/222\]. *The sun blinking on the gleaming bones*.

Modifier might not agree with its following head, if the noun phrase as a whole is a modifier in another noun phrase:

1. `aran linta ciryalíva` \[PE17/147\]. *King of Swift Ships*.

A demonstrative pronoun or a qualifier which serves as subject to a linking verb and predicative noun ('this is X') may either agree with that noun, or appear in the neuter:

1. `ilya sí maller raicar` \[LR/47\]. *Now all roads are bent*.

A noun in genitive II case usually behaves as an adjective, but might not agree with a head inflected for case or, in later use, if it takes on the role of genitive:

1. `linte yuldar lisse miruvóreva` \[RGEO/58\]. *Swift draughts of the sweet mead*. `miruvóreva` doesn’t agree with `yuldar` in number.

## Antecedent &mdash; Relative Pronoun

### Basic Rule

>[!RULE] Rule 1
>A relative pronoun agrees in number and gender with its antecedent, but its case is determined by its syntactical function in the relative clause (for details, →@@).

+ `i·cirya ya círa` *the ship which is putting out to sea* (sg. inanim. as the antecedent, com. as subject in the relative clause).
+ `i·nér yen antanes miquelis` *the man to who she gave a kiss* (sg. anim. as the antecedent, dat. as indirect object in the relative clause).

### Exceptions

The sense construction (→[27.6](#27.6)) is possible with relative pronouns.

For other exceptions, especially 'relative repulsion', →@@.

## Apposition {: id=app }

An appositive (→[26.21](sen.md#app)) **agrees in case** with the word it belongs to, but has **its own number and gender**:

1. `Elainen tárin Periandion ar meldenya anyáran` \[VT49/40\]. *To Elaine, queen of Hobbits and my very old friend*.

An appositive to a possessive clitic stands in the case of the host:

1. `coarya Olwe` \[WJ/369\]. *The house of him, Olwe*.
2. `tintilar i·eleni ómaryo lírinen aire-tário` \[RGEO/59\]. *The stars twinkle in her voice’s song, of the holy queen*.

>[!TLDR] To-Do
