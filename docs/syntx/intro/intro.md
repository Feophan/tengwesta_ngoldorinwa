# Introduction to Simple Sentences

Below, the basic syntactic principles and concepts that will be relevant in chapters 27 to 38 are discussed. Most of the examples are taken from the Late Quenya corpus, but if the example was adapted from earlier materials, the reference has an additional remark.

Chapters 40 to 52 deal with the various types of subordinate constructions found in
complex sentences (subordinate clauses, participles, and infinitives): these will be separately introduced in chapter 39.
