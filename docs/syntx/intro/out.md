# Elements Interrupting or Outside the Syntax of a Sentence

## Parentheses

Sentences may be interrupted by other sentences &mdash; **parentheses**. These are often relatively short, and frequently contain some form of comment, as in:

> `lá caritas,` **`navin`**`, alasaila ná` [PE22/154]. *Not doing this would be, I think, unwise*.

> `á zac' i·fende,` **`mecin`** [PE22/166]. *Close the door, please*.

## Elements 'Outside' the Syntax of a Sentence

Some elements stand 'outside' the sentence, i.e. they are not part of the syntactic structure of predicates, complements and modifiers. The most important of these are:

+ **forms of address** (&rarr;30.55):

	> `a Aina Faire, Eru órava o·messë` [VT44/15]. *God, the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us*.

+ **exclamations**, **interjections**, etc. (also, in answers, `ná` *yes*):

	> `mal á·me etelecta ulcullo: násie` [VT43/23]. *But deliver us from evil: Amen*.

	> `Arwen vanimelda, namárie` [LotR/352]. *Arwen beautiful and beloved, farewell*.

	> `e man antaváro` [LR/63]. *What will he give indeed?*
