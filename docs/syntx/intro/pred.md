# Predicative Modifiers

Some constituents simultaneously serve as adverbial modifier and to modify the head
of a noun phrase. Such constituents are called predicative modifiers: they occur in the form of adjectives and especially participles, which agree with their noun in case. For example:

> `ampanaina i·már ga·tatallane·s` [MQ: PE22/108]. *While it was being built people marveled at the house*. The participle `ampanaina` agrees with the subject `i·már`: it describes the house. At the same time, it serves as an adverbial modifier, describing the circumstances/time of occurence.


> `man hlaruva carcar yarra izilme ilcalasse` [MC/222]. *Who shall hear the rocks snarling in the moon gleaming?* The participle `ilcalasse` agrees with `izilme`; it describes the moon. At the same time, it serves as an adverbial modifier, describing the circumstances/time of rocks’ snarling.
