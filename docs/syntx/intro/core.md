# The Sentence Core

## Predicate, Subject, Object, Complement

Most sentences (for the exceptions, &rarr;26.13) contain at least a **predicate** (nearly always a finite verb) and one or more **obligatory constituents** that belong to that predicate; together these make up the **sentence core**.
 
+ Nearly all verbs take at least one obligatory constituent, a **subject**. Subjects are marked by the *common case* (&rarr;30.2), and predicates agree with it in number (&rarr;27.1). Some verbs take only a subject:

	> `tintilar`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `i·eleni`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [RGEO/58]. *The stars twinkle*.

	> `i·arcanwar`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `tauvar`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [PE22/147]. *The thrones endure*.

	> `ulo`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `úva`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [PE22/167]. *The rain is coming*.

+ Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the **direct object**, which is also marked by the *common case* (&rarr;30.8); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called **complements**):

	> `Varda`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `máryat`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> `ortane`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [LotR/377]. *Varda has uplifted her hands*;

	> `ilye tier`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> `unduláve`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `lumbule`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [LotR/377]. *All paths are drowned deep in shadows*;

	> `ortírielyanna`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>complement</sub></span> `rucimme`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [VT44/5]. *We fly to thy patronage*;

	> `i·jarma`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `tentane`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `Melcorello`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> [VT49/7]. *The left hand pointed away from Melkor*.

+ Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object, which is marked by the dative case (&rarr;30.27); other verbs take a second complement in the common case:

	> `Varda`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `enquantuva`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `i·yulma`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> `nin`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>indirect object</sub></span> [VT49/7]. *Varda will fill the cup for me*;

	> `lá navin`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `caritalya·s`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> `mára`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>complement</sub></span> [PE22/154]. *I don't advise you to do so*.

In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, &rarr;26.16-23).

Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are:


+ **prepositional phrases** (consisting of a preposition and its complement):

	> `i`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `or ilye mahalmar`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>complement</sub></span> `ea`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [UT/305]. *Who is above all thrones*.
	
+ **adverbs**:

	<a name="ex-11"></a>
	> `lende`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `tanna`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>complement</sub></span> `Nieliccilis`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [PE16/96]. *Thither came little Niéle*.
	
+ **subordinate clauses**:

	> `savin`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `i Elessarno quetie naite`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> [PE22/158]. *I believe that the words of Aragorn are true*. The declarative subordinate clause (&rarr;41) fulfills the role of object with the predicate `savin`: compare `Elessar` in `savin Elessar` *'I believe Aragorn'*.

+ **infinitive constructions**:

	> `man`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `cenuva`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `fána cirya círa`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> [MC/221]. *Who shall see a white ship leave*. The common-and-infinitive construction (&rarr;51.21) fulfills the role of object with the predicate `cenuva`: compare `andúne` in `man cenuva métim' andúne?` *'Who shall see the last evening?'*
	
+ **participle constructions**:

	> `lie`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `tatallaner`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `i·már ampanaina`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> [MQ: PE22/108]. *While it was being built people marveled at the house*. The common-and-participle construction (&rarr;52.13) fulfills the role of object with the predicate `tatallaner`: compare `i·már` in `tatallanen i·már` *'I marveled at the house'*.
	
When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a **complex sentence**. For complex sentences, &rarr;39.

!!! note
	The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus `fire` *die* has a valency of one, `anta` *give* has a valency of three.
	
	Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb `cire`, when it takes only a subject, means *sail*, but may also take an *object* and then means *cut*.
	
	The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence.
	
	It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as `tanna` [above](#ex-11), and with verbs which may have different valencies. In reality, syntactic 'obligatoriness' is better seen as a scale, with constituents being *more* or *less* obligatory depending on the verb and construction used.

There are a few verbs which do not have a subject ('impersonal' verbs, &rarr;36), and very few of these take no other obligatory constituents (i.e. have a valency of zero). The sentence core then consists of nothing but the verb: e.g. `úla` *it is raining*.

## 'Omission' of the Subject and Other Constituents

That a verb takes a certain number of obligatory constituents does not mean that all those constituents are necessarily expressed every single time that verb is used. A constituent may be omitted if it is sufficiently **clear from the context** who or what is meant:

<a name="ex-15"></a>
> `roccor i·Erulingaron máre nár? Nár` [PE22/166]. *The horses of Rohirrim are good, are they not? They are*. The second sentence has no explicit subject — 'horses' has been the subject of the previous sentence and need not be mentioned explicitly again. Note that these constituents have to be supplied in translation ('they').
	
> `savin Elessar ar i náne aran Ondóreo` [PE22/158]. *I believe Aragorn, and that he was a King of Gondor*. *Elessar* doesn’t need to be mentioned explicitly again.
	
> `á zac' i·fende` [PE22/166]. *Close the door*. English, too, normally omits the subject with imperatives.

<a name="ex-18"></a>	
> `h·ore nin carita·s nó namin alasaila` [VT41/13]. *I would like to do so but judge it unwise*. Note how the second sentence has no explicit object, added in the translation ('it')[^1].

The lack of an explicit, separately expressed subject is particularly frequent in Quenya, and constitutes a regular feature of the language. Information about the subject of a verb is then *usually* expressed by the **personal ending** of that verb:

> **`merin`** `sa` **`h·aryalye`** `galasse nó` **`vanyalye`** `Ambarello` [MS/1]. *I hope that you have happiness before you pass from the world*. The subjects ('I', 'you') are expressed by the first- and second-person singular endings.

<a name="ex-20"></a>
> **`melinye·s`** `apa lá hé` [VT49/15]. *I love him but not him (the other)*. The subjects ('I') is expressed by the first-person singular ending, while the first object ('him') by singular object clitic.

In the third person, the omission of the subject is regular if the subject of the previous sentence is continued, as in ([15](#ex-15)). If the subject changes, an explicitly expressed subject is normally required (VT49/14-15).

In the first and second person, explicitly expressed subjects (in the form of the personal pronouns `ní`, `lyé`, etc.) are used only for emphasis or contrast. For such 'contrastive' pronouns, &rarr;29.1-4.

!!! note
	The omission of other elements than the subject (such as the object in ([18](#ex-18))) is much more restricted and infrequent than the lack of an explicitly expressed subject. The object can be substituted for a short clitic form which closely follows the verb ([20](#ex-20)) in third person only.
	
## Linking Verb, Predicative Complement

A **linking verb** (or **copulative**/**copular verb**, **copula**) 'links' a subject to a nominal constituent, the so-called **predicative complement**, which identifies the subject or assigns a property to it. The predicative complement is usually an **adjective** which agrees in case and number with the subject, or a **noun** which agrees with the subject in case (&rarr;27.7, 30.3).

Examples of verbs that can function as linking verbs are `na` *be*, `ole` *become*, `lare` *remain, stay*, `neme` *seem, appear to be, prove to be*, etc.

> [`vanwa`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicative adjective</sub></span> `ná`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>linking verb</sub></span>]<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `Valimar`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [LotR/377]. *Lost is Valimar*.

> [`nése`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>linking verb</sub></span> `nórima rocco`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicative noun phrase</sub></span>]<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [VT49/29]. *He was a horse strong at running*.

!!! note
	Predicative nouns or adjectives are sometimes called 'predicate nouns/adjectives'. Predicative complements agreeing with a subject are also sometimes called 'subject(ive) complements'.
	
Linking verbs also occur with an adverbial expression of place or circumstance as their complement: e.g. `ná` *be (somewhere), find oneself (somewhere)*. But normally special verbs of position are used instead: `tule` *get somewhere*, `hare` *stay somewhere*. In many grammatical treatments, such complements are also seen as predicative complements:

> `ní`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [`nauva`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>linking verb</sub></span> `tanome`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>complement</sub></span>]<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [VT49/19]. *I will be there*.

The verb `ná`, unlike its English counterpart, doesn’t occur in the meaning *exist*. An expression like `tasse ná` *'there is'* can have only contrastive meaning 'but not here'. In the '**existential**' use, the verb `ea` with only a subject is used instead. The verb `tule` also has an existential use, and then means *happen*:

> `vahaia` `nóre`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `ea`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `i ga·esta Valinor` [MQ: PE22/124]. *Far a way there is a land called Valinor*.

Some other verbs link an object to a predicative complement that agrees with that object (both are in the common). Examples of such verbs are *consider X (to be) Y, make X Y, appoint X as Y* (for more details, &rarr;30.10):

> `alasaila ná lá care` `tai`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>object</sub></span> `mo`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [`nave`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>verb</sub></span> `mára`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicative adjective</sub></span>]<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [PE22/154]. *It is unwise not to do what one judges good*.

!!! note
	Predicative complements agreeing with an object are sometimes called 'object(ive) complements'.
	
## Omission of a Linking Verb: Nominal Sentences

Frequently, a linking verb such as `na` is lacking in a sentence, whose core then contains only nominal elements. This occurs especially in the following cases:

+ when predicative adjective follows the subject:
	
	> `i·roccor`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `rindi`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [MQ: PE21/78]. *The horses are swift*;
	
	> `Elessarno quetie`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `naite`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> [PE22/158]. *The words of Aragorn are true.*
	
	Unless the subject is not expressed, or is separated from a predicate:
	
	> `yá hríve mene,` `ringa`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicative adjective</sub></span> `ná`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>linking verb</sub></span> [VT49/23]. *When winter comes, it is cold*. Impersonal use (lit. 'cold is'); for this, &rarr;37.3.
	
	> `vanwa`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicative adjective</sub></span> `ná`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>linking verb</sub></span>`, Rómello vanwa,` `Valimar`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span>`!` [LotR/377]. *Lost, lost to those from the east is Valimar!*
	
+ if the subject is postponed, but is separated from a predicate with a definite article:

	> `mana`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `i·coimas Eldaron`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [PM/395]. *What is the 'coimas' of the Eldar?*
	
	> `aistana`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `i·yáve mónalyo`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> [VT43/31]. *Blessed is the fruit of thy womb*.
	
+ with explicit pronouns:

	> `aistana`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>predicate</sub></span> `elye`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>subject</sub></span> `imíca nísi` [VT43/28]. *Blessed art thou amongst women*.
	
+ with adverbs of position and direction:

	> `tasse i·osto` [MQ: PE22/124]. ***There*** *is the city*.
	
	> `manna lé sinnar` [MQ: PE22/124]. *Where are you going this morning?*
	
+ with prepositional phrases:

	> `i·Héru` `as·elye`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>prepositional phrase</sub></span> [VT43/28]. *The Lord is with thee.*
	
	> `quiquie menin coaryanna,` `ar·se`<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>prepositional phrase</sub></span> [VT49/23]. *Whenever I get to his house, he is out.*
	
+ in formulaic questions:

	> `ma naite?` [PE22/166]. *Is it true?*
	
Only the present indicative of `na` *be* is regularly omitted as linking verb in this way: other forms such as imperfect `náne` or future `nauva` are not normally omitted, unless other indications of time are present, especially in expressions of location or direction of movement:

> `masse lé enar?` [MQ: PE22/124]. *Where will you be tomorrow?*

[^1]: Also, `nai elye hiruva` [LotR/378].

*[MQ]: Middle Quenya
