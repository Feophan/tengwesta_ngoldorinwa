# Impersonal Constructions

## Introduction

Impersonal verbs have no subject in the normal sense. Such verbs always appear in the **third person singular**. They can be further divided in the following categories:

+ '**Quasi-impersonal**' **verbs**, for which an infinitive or subordinate clause functions as the subject; for details, &rarr; @@ below.

+ '**Proper**' **impersonal verbs**, which have no subject at all. This group is virtually limited to weather terms, expressions of time, and 'impersonal passive' constructions; for details, &rarr;@@ below.

Some proper impersonal verbs do not have a subject, but do take other obligatory constituents, especially in dative.

!!! note
	English impersonal verbs use the so-called "dummy pronoun" *it*, e.g. *It is raining*. With English quasi-impersonal verbs *it* 'anticipates' the subordinate construction, e.g. *It is clear that he is coming* (cf. *That he is coming is clear*.)
	
<!-- For infinitives of impersonal constructions, &rarr;@@. For participles of impersonal constructions (especially the accusative absolute construction), &rarr;@@. -->

## Quasi-Impersonal Verbs and Constructions

### Verbs

The following common quasi-impersonal verbs take an (accusative-and-) infinitive construction as their subject (&rarr;@@), and frequently also a complement in the dative:

+ `ecë nin care sa` [VT49/20] *I can do that*
+ `orë nin caritas` [VT41/13] *I feel an urge to do it*

### Adjectives; Nouns

The **singular** of many **adjectives** is used with a third-person singular form of `ná` *be* in quasi-impersonal constructions, taking an (accusative-and-)infinitive construction or `i`-clause. For example:

+ `ninya ná carita·s` *I need to do this*[^fn1]
+ `alasaila ná lá carë tai mo nave mára` *it is unwise not to do what one judges good*

Some **nouns** are similarly used in quasi-impersonal constructions. For example:

+ `umbe nin i hríve nauva urra` *I have a feeling that winter will be bad*

With such adjectives and nouns `ná` is very often omitted (&rarr;@@):

### Weather and Time Expressions

Weather verbs such as the following are used impersonally:

+ `ulë` *it rains*
+ `niquë` *it is cold*
+ `hrisë` *it snows*

!!! tip "Assumption"
	Some expressions of time use an impersonal form of `ná` *be*:

	+ `(ná) telwa` *it is late*
	+ `(ná) tensi andúne` *it is already sunset*
	
### Impersonal Passives

Frequently what is translated into English with a passive voice is expressed in Quenya as an impersonal construction:

+ `(a)·mate·s` [PE22/107] *it is eaten*
+ `masse akime aldar?` [PE22/125] *where are the trees (to be found)?*
+ `vahaia nóre ëa i a-esta Valinor` [PE22/124] *far away there is a land called Valinor*

Impersonal passives are made by omitting the subject from the active sentence: the apersonal form of the verb is used with or without a marker `a` (used to avoid confusion with the infinitive use of apersonal form), which was usually optional in PQ but became more grammaticalized in TQ.

When the impersonal passive[^fn2] is used as an object of infinitive, this `a·` is however obligatory: 

+ `man cenuva lumbor a·hosta?` [MC/222] *Who shall see the clouds get gathered?*

[^fn1]: Based on the `inya karie·te` [PE22/123]
[^fn2]: Whether it is actually passive or not by [WALS](https://wals.info/chapter/107) definition depends on whether `a` can be considered a "special morphological marking of the verb"
