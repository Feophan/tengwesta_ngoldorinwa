# The Verb: Tense and Aspect

## Basic Notions and Terminology

### Tense

**Tense** concerns the location of an action in time relative to some other moment. A distinction can be made between absolute tense and relative tense:

+ **Absolute tense** concerns the location of an action in the past, present or future, relative to the moment of speaking:

	The Noldor **burned** Alqualonde. *past*<br>
	The Noldor **are burning** Alqualonde. *present*<br>
	The Noldor **will burn** Alqualonde. *future*
	
+ **Relative tense** concerns the location of an action in time **relative to another temporal reference point given in the context**, either prior to that reference point (**anteriority**), at the same time as that reference point (**simultaneity**), or after it (**posteriority**):

	We arrived when the Noldor **had burned** Alqualonde. *anterior* to a moment in the past<br>
	We arrived when the Noldor **were burning** Alqualonde. *simultaneous* with a moment in the past<br>
	By the time we arrive, the Noldor **will have burned** Alqualonde. *anterior* to a moment in the future<br>
	The Noldor said that they **would burn** Alqualonde. *posterior* to a moment in the past
	
The **indicatives** of the Quenya verb, when used in main clauses, express absolute tense:

+ the **present indicative** and **perfect indicative** refer to the **present** (i.e. the moment of speaking);
+ the **imperfect** and **preterite** refer to the **past**;
+ the **future indicative** refers to the **future**:

EXAMPLES

Outside main clauses, indicatives frequently receive a relative-tense interpretation in addition to, or instead of, an absolute-tense interpretation (@@ below).

<!---
**Moods other than the indicative** (i.e. the subjunctive, optative and imperative) and **non-finite forms of the verb** (infinitives, participles and verbal adjectives), **do not inherently express tense**, but only aspect. Their aspectual value, however, may lead to a relative-tense interpretation (@@ below).

### Aspect

#### Grammatical Aspect

Grammatical aspect (usually simply called 'aspect') concerns the way in which an action is presented or regarded, particularly with respect to its internal composition: it can be presented as a single and complete whole (an action in its entirety), without any separate component parts of the action being envisaged, or as incomplete (an action that is ongoing or repeated, that can conceivably be interrupted), with several component parts being envisaged. Note that what matters is not whether an action has component parts, but whether the speaker is interested in presenting these component parts as relevant.

With the exception of the future-tense forms (see below) all Quenya verb forms express aspect.

The tense-aspect stems of the Quenya verb express three different aspectual values:

+ The aorist stems have a temporal value but no aspectual one: they are aspectually neutral, and make no formal distinction between an imperfective (incomplete) or perfective (complete) presentation of actions.

+ The present stem presents an action as incomplete, focusing on one or more of its intermediate stages, but leaving its boundaries (beginning and end) out of focus. It thus normally signifies that an action is ongoing. This is called continuous aspect.

+ The perfect stem present an action as a state resulting from a preceding completed action, or it signifies that the effects of the completed action are somehow still relevant.
