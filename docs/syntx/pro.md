#Pronouns and Quantifiers

## Personal Pronouns

### Accented and Non-Accented Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are used only pronominally (&rarr;26.22-3). They are either accented (**stressed** and **emphatic**) or non-accented (for details, &rarr;7.1-2): to an extent, this distinction corresponds to a contrastive and a non-contrastive function. When describing the subject, and no (contrastive) emphasis is needed, the personal endings of the verb suffice. The unaccented pronouns are then only used in **oblique cases**.
{: .ref #29}

+ `cé tulis, tanome nauvan` [VT49/19]. *If he comes, I will be there*. No emphasis on the subject.
{: .exp}

+ `nai lye hiruva airea Amanar` [AUCT-LET/1963-12-18]. *May thee find a blessed Yule*. Unaccented pronoun in oblique case.
{: .exp}

Contrast signals to a listener that the utterance should be taken as one of several alternatives. Depending on their importance, contrast might be **exhaustive** or **uncertain**.
{: .ref #29}

**Exhaustive** is contrast where all relevant alternatives are covered, either explicitly in several clauses, or implicitly with entity present in the context:
{: .ref #29}

+ `inye túle, apa isse úne` [&mdash;]. ***I*** *came, but* ***HE*** *didn’t*. All other alternatives (e.g. me not coming, or him coming) are explicitly dismissed.
{: .exp}

+ `nai elye hiruva` [LotR/378]. *Maybe* ***THOU*** *shalt find it*. Galadriel implicitly contrasts herself to Frodo, expecting never to come back to Valimar herself.
{: .exp}

Alternatives of exhaustive contrast are generally mutually exclusive.

With an **uncertain** contrast the speaker is only making a claim about the referent of the pronoun and leaves it open whether this claim should or should not apply to the other referents relevant in the discourse:
{: .ref #29}

+ `cé tulis, ní nauva tanome` [VT49/19]. *If he comes,* ***I*** *will be there*. Whether anyone else will be there is left on the table.
{: .exp}

Unlike alternatives of exhaustive contrast, here they don’t need to be exclusive.

Another factor is **focality**. Some of the typical cases include clefts, answers to wh-questions, comparative constructions, focus constructions, etc:
{: .ref #29}

+ `melinye sé apa lá hé` [VT49/15]. *I love* ***HIM****, but not* ***HIM***. The answer to a question: '**Whom** do you love?'
{: .exp}

Main purpose of an accented pronoun in such position is to *identify* a referent as one of several alternatives, or to *exhaust* the set by dismissing all other alternatives:

+ `aistana elye imíca nísi` [VT43/28]. *Blessed art* ***THOU*** *amongst women*. Exhaustive pronoun implies that only Mary is considered.
{: .exp}

!!! tip
	The difference between stressed and emphatic pronouns then comes to differentiate between these two classes of contrast. Exhaustive contrast is denoted by emphatic pronouns, often appended in translation to English with *only* or *even*. Stressed pronouns are used then for weak, identifying contrast. However, this distinction does not always hold.
	
### First and Second Person

First-person pronoun refers to a speaker, and in addition to number and accent distinguishes clusivity: listener can be either involved (**inclusive** 'we') or specifically excepted (**exclusive** 'we') from the context.
{: .ref #29}

|           	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-----------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg.       	| ni         	| ní       	| inye     	|
| pl. incl. 	| we         	| wé       	| elwe     	|
| pl. excl. 	| me         	| mé       	| elme     	|
| d. incl.  	| wet        	| wét      	| inque    	|
| d. excl.  	| met        	| mét      	| emme     	|

 Second-person pronoun refers to a listener, and has different levels of formality:
 {: .ref #29}
 
|           	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-----------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg. familiar 	| tye         	| tyé      	| itye     	|
| sg. formal 	| lye         	| lyé      	| elye     	|
| pl.		 	| le         	| lé       	| elde     	|
| d.		  	| lyet        	| lyét     	| este     	|

!!! note
	In colloquial speech, particularly of Men, *plural exclusive* form was sometimes used for first person plural in general. This was considered incorrect by Ngoldor[^ppro2].   

	Later, except for colloquial speech, familiar `tye` was eventually displaced by `lye`. To denote respect `tar` *sir, madam* could be used instead[^ppro3].
	
!!! attention "To-Do"
	Add `-tar` inflection.
	
### Third and Fourth Person

Third- and fourth-person pronouns refer to an entity other than a speaker or a listener. To alleviate the ambiguity between several actors within the same phrase, first actor is marked as third-person, and the following as fourth:
{: .ref #29}

+ `sé ringane hé, ar hé runce` [modified VT49/15]. *He struck* ***him****, and* ***he*** *fled*. There is no ambiguity, as there would be in English.
{: .exp}

Third and fourth person distinguish **animate** and **inanimate** gender. Distinction is semantic: animates are noun capable to act on their own volition (including trees and plants), and inanimates are the rest (including abstract concepts).
{: .ref #29}

+ third-person pronouns:

|             	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-------------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg. anim.   	| se         	| sé       	| isse     	|
| pl. anim.   	| te         	| té       	| inte     	|
| sg. inanim. 	| sa         	| sá       	| issa     	|
| pl. inanim. 	| ta(i)      	| tá       	| inta     	|
| d.          	| tu         	| tú       	| itte     	|

+ fourth-person pronouns (only singular):

|             	| unaccented 	| stressed 	| emphatic 	|
|-------------	|------------	|----------	|----------	|
| sg. anim.   	| je         	| jé       	| ecse     	|
| sg. inanim. 	| ja         	| já       	| ecsa     	|

## Reflexive Pronouns and Other Reflexive Expressions

### Introduction; Pronouns Used as Reflexives; Direct and Indirect Reflexives

**Reflexivity** is the phenomenon whereby a pronoun is used to 'reflect' (i.e. refer back or forwards to) another constituent of the sentence or clause, nearly always the subject:
{: .ref #29}

+ `an cé mo querne immo númenna` [draft VT49/6]. *For if one turned oneself westward*.
{: .exp}

A distinction is made between:
{: .ref #29}

+ **direct reflexivity**: pronouns which refer back to an element within the same clause/construction;
+ **indirect reflexivity**: pronouns in a subordinate construction (subordinate clauses, infinitive or participle constructions), which refer back to an element in the main/matrix clause (for subordination, &rarr;39.2, 39.5):

+ `Elerondo quente insen` *Elrond said to himself*. Direct reflexive: `inse` is the indirect object of `quente`, and refers to its subject.
{: .exp}

+ `Elerondo hlasse sa Elessar quente sen` *Elrond heard what Aragorn told him*. Indirect reflexive: `sen` refers back to the subject of `hlasse`, but syntactically is a part of the dependent clause.
{: .exp}

!!! tip
	Like English, Quenya doesn't use reflexive pronouns with **introverted actions** unlike many other languages, preferring bare intransitive verbs. Typical extroverted verbs are transitive verbs like 'kill', 'hate', 'criticize', 'see', 'attack', and typical introverted verbs are verbs like 'wash', 'shave', 'dress', 'defend'.
	
	Some introverted actions might be expressed by the mediopassive voice, but only with certain verbs ('verbs of grooming', &rarr;35.11). Extroverted actions always require a pronoun.

The following pronouns are used in reflexive constructions:
{: .ref #29}

+ the reflexive pronoun (`imne`, `imule`, `inse`, etc., &rarr;7.3);
+ (oblique cases of) the personal pronoun (`ni`, `lye, `se`, etc., &rarr;7.2);
+ reflexive inflection.

!!! note
	A distinction should thus be maintained between 'reflexive pronouns' (a morphological category, referring to a specific type of pronoun, `inse`, etc.) and 'pronouns used in reflexive constructions' (a syntactic phenomenon). While reflexive pronouns always express reflexivity, reflexivity is not always necessarily marked by the use of a reflexive pronoun.

### Pronouns Used as Direct and Indirect Reflexives

#### Obviation

In many (or perhaps most) languages, nonsubject anaphoric personal pronouns are **obviative**, i.e. they cannot be coreferential with a coargument: 
{: .ref #29}

+ The dogs<sub>1</sub> bit them<sub>2/\*1</sub>.
{: .exp}

Quenya, however, has three types of third person anaphoric pronouns: an obviative nonreflexive pronoun `je`, a nonobviative nonreflexive pronun `se`, and a reflexive pronoun `inse`:[^refl2]

+ `Zindacollo`<sub>1</sub> `tatalla` `je`<sub>2</sub>/`se`<sub>1/2</sub>/`inse`<sub>1</sub>. *Thingol admires him*<sub>2</sub>/*him(self)*<sub>1/2</sub>/*himself*<sub>1</sub>.
{: .exp}

Note how the use of `se` can be ambiguous.

#### Direct Reflexivity

In the direct reflexive use, the **reflexive pronoun** is normally required, particularly for emphasis (&rarr;29.2-5) or to distinguish from reciprocal use of personal pronoun (&rarr;29.14).
{: .ref #29}

+ `Arwen cenne inse i·cilintilasse` *Arwen saw herself in the mirror*.
{: .exp}  

However, **personal pronouns** can be used as direct reflexives, especially in the first and second person, and in poetry much more freely than in prose.
{: .ref #29}

+ `ni·cúven` *I hid myself*.
{: .exp}

If the third person is **implicit**, verb receives a reflexive ending:
{: .ref #29}

+ `melisse`/`melitte` [VT49/21]. *He loves himself*/*they love themselves*.
{: .exp}

#### Indirect Reflexivity

In indirect reflexive context, the nonobviative nonrelexive pronouns are used (reflexive pronoun is **bound locally**):
{: .ref #29}

+ `Arcimbelenna leltaniéla h·oraneltet roccor téna ta rimba ve cárima tulta` *They*<sub>1</sub> *sent to Rivendell and asked that they*<sub>2</sub> *send them*<sub>1/3</sub> *as many horses as possible*. `téna` refers back to the subject of `h·oraneltet` (1), though obviative interpretation (3) is possible. `inte` could only refer to the subject of infinitive clause (2).
{: .exp}
	
[^refl2]: The same system exists in Turkish.

## Possessive Pronouns and Other Expressions of Possession

Quenya uses the following pronominal constructions to express possession, belonging,
descent, origin, etc.:
{: .ref #29}

+ possessive suffixes, &rarr;7.7;
+ possessive pronouns (`ninya`, `lelya`, `séva`, etc., &rarr;7.8).

Separate possessive pronouns may be used pronominally or adnominally. In the latter
case, they are normally used for emphasis (&rarr;29.2-5), and in poetry much more freely than in prose:

+ `nan úye sére indo-ninya símen, ullume` [LR/72]. *But my heart resteth not here for ever*.
{: .exp}

+ `ávatyara mello menye roctar` [draft; VT43/11]. *Forgive us our trespasses*.
{: .exp}

## Reciprocal Pronouns

The **reciprocal** construction expresses the idea that two or more persons are **simultaneously involved** in one and the same action, like English *each other*, *one another*.
{: .ref #29}

Reciprocal actions can be expressed in Quenya by the preverb `o·` *with* (e.g. `o·mennente` *they met each other*), by the personal pronoun (`te palpanente` *they hit each other*) and by the repetition of cognates:

+ `má sove má` *Hands wash each other*.
{: .exp}

## Demonstrative Pronouns

### Pointing Outside or Inside the Text

Demonstratives have a pointing or **deictic** function. They may either point to someone/thing in the world **outside the text**, or to a single word or larger segment of **the text itself**.
{: .ref #29}

+ `Telperinquar Erciandello tence sine tenguar` [translated; LotR/305]. *Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs*. `sine` refers to the signs actually present on the door, &rarr; we might imagine Celebrimbor pointing at them.
{: .exp}

+ `lende tanna Nieliccelis, sana wende nieninquea` [PE16/96]. *Thither came little Niéle, that maiden like a snowdrop*. The pronoun refers to element in the text, anaphorically to Niéle.
{: .exp}

When pointing outside of the text, demonstratives distinguish between proximal `sina` *this by me*, medial `tana` *that by you*, and distal `enta` *yonder*:
{: .ref #29}

+ `sina` refers to something immediately near to the speaker (physically or mentally);
+ `tana` refers to something within the reach of the speaker and/or addressee (physically or mentally), but not specifically near to the speaker;
+ `enta` refers to something beyond the reach of the speaker and addressee (physically or mentally).

When a demonstrative refers to an element in the text itself it may refer backward to something introduced before (anaphoric use) or point forward in the text to something about to be introduced (cataphoric use):
{: .ref #29}

+ `sina` or `enta` normally serve to announce something that will follow immediately, or refer to something prominent in the speaker's mind;
+ `sana` is used most often to refer to something mentioned previously;
+ to refer to something which has not been mentioned for a while (or to pick up something which was mentioned before a form of `sana` or `sina` 'intervened') a form of `yana` *former* must be used instead.

### Further Particulars

Forms of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs usually have short and long forms (&rarr;7.18). The long demonstrative nearly always carries heavier stress:
{: .ref #29}

+ `sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambarmetta` [LotR/967]. *In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world*.
{: .exp}

+ `umbe nin i hríve nauva urra si loa` [PE22/168]. *I have a feeling that winter will be bad this year*.
{: .exp}

## Sentential Pronouns

While personal pronouns refer to specific words or noun phrases (or constructions operating as noun phrases), sometimes we might need to mention a larger segment of a conversation instead, a clause or a sequence of clauses. Alongside demonstrative pronouns, Quenya has two additional **sentential pronouns** for this case — subjective `ha` and objective `sa` (similar to `sana`, &rarr;29.14):
{: .ref #29}

+ `yára Túro mante ilqua masta, ha mé·ne úmactale` [PE22/119]. *Old Turo ate all the bread, that was a nuisance to us*. Pronoun `ha` means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'.
{: .exp}

+ `yára Túro mante ilqua masta. Mé·láner fasta sa` [modified; PE22/119]. *Old Turo ate all the bread. We were not pleased with that*. Pronoun `sa` means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'.
{: .exp}

## Indefinite Pronouns

The indefinite pronouns refer to someone or something that is not immediately identifiable. They can appear in the varying contexts, some of which include:
{: .ref #29}

+ When **the speaker does not wish to reveal**, or pay attention to, the identity of a specific individual:
	
	+ `námo tule, intya man` *Someone came, guess who*.
	{: .exp}

+ When referring to individuals whose specific identity is **unknown** or **irrelevant**:

	+ `hlassen ma, mal ú istan manima` *I heard something, but I don't know of what sort*.
	{: .exp}

+ When referring to something **non-specific** or **non-existing**:

	+ `neve ma h·ecsa, mecin` *Please, try something else*[^inf2].
	{: .exp}

+ In **comparison**, **condition** and **possibility**:

	+ `náse halda lá aiquen` *He is taller than anyone*;
	{: .exp}
	
	+ `cé cenil aiquen, quetá nin` *Shall you see anyone, tell me*;
	{: .exp}
	
	+ `lertal mique aiquen` *You may kiss anyone*.
	{: .exp}
	
+ In **negation** and **polar question**:

	+ `ú cennen úquen` *I haven't seen anyone*;
	{: .exp}
	
	+ `ú novin i úquen tuluva` *I don't think anyone will come*;
	{: .exp}
	
	+ `ma úquen quente lyen úqua pá·sa?` *Has anyone told you anything about that?*
	{: .exp}
	
The summary of these functions is shown on the chart:
	
![Implication map](../img/indef_pron.png)

*Figure 29.1: Implication map: indefinite pronouns of Quenya*

There are also groups of indefinite adjectives and adverbs which form related series with indefinite pronouns (&rarr;7.14). Their functions are crudely summarized in the table:
{: .ref #29}


|          	| na-series 	| bare 	| m-series 	| ai/qui-series	| ú-series 	|
|----------	|-----------	|------	|----------	|-----------	|----------	|
| person   	| námo[^inf3]     	| quen 	| mo       	| aiquen    	| úquen    	|
| thing    	| nat       	| qua  	| ma       	| aiqua     	| úqua     	|
| location 	| nanome    	| nome 	| ---	  	| quinome    	| únome    	|
| time     	| nalume    	| lume 	| ---	  	| quie	    	| úlume    	|

[^inf2]: `h·ecsa` *else* from `√HEK` > `hekra`, cf. EQ. `varya`, MQ `micsa`.
[^inf3]: `eo` in the chart is archaic.

## Generic Pronouns

The pronoun `mo` is used as a **generic pronoun** in:
{: .ref #29}

+ generalized statements of speaker’s experiences and expectations:

	+ `matie telumbi sine cé nace mo` *One can die from eating these mushrooms*.
	{: .exp}
	
+ advises and instructions which should affect the listener's practical reasoning:

	+ `alasaila ná lá care tai mo nave mára` [PE22/154]. *It is unwise not to do what one judges good*.
	{: .exp}

+ putting a speaker into the other person's situation in conditional statement:

	+ `cé mo querne cendele númenna, i·jarma tentane Melcorello` [VT49/8]. *If one turned the face westward, the left hand pointed away from Melkor*.
	{: .exp}

+ in sayings and aphorisms:
	
	+ `mo ú coita rie massenen` *You cannot live on bread alone*.
	{: .exp}
	
!!! note
	On impersonal constructions of exclusive generic statement (cf. E. *they*), &rarr;36.14.
	
	In colloquial speech `mo` can generally be replaced with inclusive 'we'.

!!! Assumption	
	The generic pronoun `ma` *one, thing* can be used as a generic *they* when referring to classes of things:
	
	+ `moa nin cirma; masse hepilye ma?` *I need a knife. Where do you keep them?*
	{: .exp}
	
## Interrogative Pronouns

For the use of interrogative pronouns `man` *who?*, `mana` *what?* in direct and indirect questions, &rarr;38.11-14 and 42.5-6.
{: .ref #29}

## Relative Pronouns

For the use of relative pronouns, &rarr;50.8-16.
{: .ref #29}

## Quantifiers

#### ilya

The quantifier `ilya` in the singular means *each, every*. In the plural, it means *all*:
{: .ref #29}

+ `ilya osto` *each/every city* (sometimes: *an entire city*)
{: .exp}
	
+ `ilye ostor` *all the cities*
{: .exp}

The corresponding **universal pronouns** are `ilquen` *everyone* and `illi` *all*. 

#### quana

The quantifier `quana`[^qua1] means *whole, entire*:
{: .ref #29}

+ `tirá quana tama` *Look at the entire matter*.
{: .exp}

#### er

`er` means *by itself, alone, the only*:
{: .ref #29}

+ `er hinyan na anta i·ríe` *To my only child shall be given a crown*.
{: .exp}
	
#### enta and jana

The basic meaning of `enta` is *other (out of many)*, stressing **similarity**. The basic meaning of `jana` is *other (than something else)*, stressing **difference**:
{: .ref #29}

+ `ólamar ar ente lámar` *consonants and other sounds*;
{: .exp}
	
+ `ólamar jane lámar lá ómar` *consonants are different sounds than vowels*.
{: .exp}
	
### Indefinite Marker as Quantifier

In many cases the indefinite marker (&rarr;4.7) can be translated to English with quantifier *some*. When it stands with the article it means *many*:
{: .ref #29}

+ `i·falmalinnar imbe met` [LotR/377]. *Upon the many foaming waves between us two*.
{: .exp}

When modified by a quantifier `nótima` it means *(a) few*:
{: .ref #29}

+ `cennen nótime eldali` [PE22/155]. *I saw a few Elves*.
{: .exp}

[^qua1]: NQ from `√KWA` 'complete, all, whole'.
