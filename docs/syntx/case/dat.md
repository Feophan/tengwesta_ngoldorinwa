The main function of the dative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers. It is also used to mark some required complements with verbs.

## As Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs)

### As Indirect Object

The dative is used to express the indirect object or the **recipient** (Y) with the following types of verbs (X indicates a direct object in the common-accusative, where present):

+ verbs meaning *give*, *entrust*, etc.;
+ verbs meaning *say*, *tell*, *report*, etc. (usually with direct or indirect statement, &rarr;41.3);
+ most verbs meaning *command, order, advise* etc. (usually together with an infinitive, &rarr;51.8);
+ most verbs meaning *seem*, *appear*, etc.

The dative as indirect object, or **experiencer**, complements the following **impersonal verbs** (&rarr;36.4-5), usually together with an infinitive (&rarr;51.8) (Y marks the dative):

+ `ece` it is possible for Y (to do something);
+ `ola` Y dreams (of something);
+ `h·ore` Y feels an urge (to do something);
+ `moa`[^1] Y must (do something);
+ `nai` it may chance for Y (to do something);	

### Dative of the Possessor

The **dative of the possessor** is used to complement 'existential' `ná` and `ea` (*there is*, &rarr;26.10), denoting possession, belonging, or interest. On the difference between this dative and verbs of possession (`same`, `harya`, etc.), &rarr; TBD.

## As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier)

### *Referring to Things or Abstract Entities*

The dative is very frequently used to express optional adverbial modifiers (&rarr;26.14). It marks nouns referring to things or abstract entities in various
kinds of adverbial modifiers.

The **dative of cause** expresses reason or cause.

The bare **dative of place** may be used to express the direction whereto action takes place, as a short form of allative:

> `lendes pallan i sír` [PE17/65]. *He came to a point far beyond the river*.

### *Referring to Persons*

The **dative of advantage** and **dative of disadvantage** are used to indicate the
beneficiary (or opposite) of an action; they express in or against whose interest an
action is performed:

> `Ilu Ilúvatar en cáre eldain a fírimoin` [MQ: LR/63]. *The Father made the World for Elves and Mortals*.

The dative also marks the person **from whose perspective or vantage point** the
action is perceived:

> `tulil márie nin` [PE22/158]. *You come happily for me*.
