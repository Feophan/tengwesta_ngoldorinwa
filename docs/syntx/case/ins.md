# Instrumental

The main function of the instrumental is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers.

## As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier)

Instrumental case, as the name implies, most commonly marks the **instrument or means** by which an action is carried out: *built with a hammer*, *painted with a brush*, *fought with fists*.

The **instrumental of material** is closely adjacent to it, and is used to complement transitive verbs and related adjectives to describe the material used in action: *built with stone*, *rich with spoils*. Note the difference: *filled with water* (instrumental of material), but *full of water* (genitive of material).

The **instrumental of manner** describes the manner in which an action was carried out, particularly with abstract nouns: *carry with weariness*, *shine with golden light*, *give in measure*.

The **instrumental of agent** is used in passive constructions to denote the agent of the action: *executed by the king*, *heard by the audience*, *blamed by the wicked*.

While the instrumental of agent is usually employed for voluntary actions of animate nouns, similar **instrumental of cause** describes the circumstances in which an action happened, sometimes tangentially, and generally can be substituted in gloss with *because of*: *disabled by a wound*, *bent with the sails*.

The **instrumental of source** is used for a resource spawning the action, particularly with the verbs of feelings: *fueled by anger*, *aroused by noise*.  

The **instrumental of location** describes location or other intrinsic relations linked to the manner or source of an action, typically of intransitive verbs, and is generally translated with *in, on*: *fall in the wind*, *cloack in veils*, *fluttering on the wings*.
