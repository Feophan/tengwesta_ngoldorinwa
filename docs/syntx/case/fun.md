# Functions, Meanings and Labels

The eight main cases of Quenya (common, genitive-partitive, genitive-adjective, dative, instrumental, locative, ablative and allative) are used in different syntactic functions:

+ to mark **obligatory constituents** with verbs and adjectives (subject, object, complement; here belong also certain uses in constructions like the common-and-infinitive, common-and-participle, etc.);
+ to complement **prepositions**;
+ to mark **attributive modifiers** (the main function of the genitive);
+ to mark various **adverbial modifiers** (here belong also certain uses in constructions like the locative absolute);
+ a few other, idiomatic uses.

In the overview below, the most important uses of each of the cases are listed, organized by syntactic function. The prepositions are treated separately, &rarr;31.
