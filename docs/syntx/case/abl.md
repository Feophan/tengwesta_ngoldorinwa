# Ablative

The main function of the ablative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the source of the motion, generally pointing out *whence*, and is therefore the very **opposite of allative**.

## As a Direction of Movement

The ablative, then, is wanted to express **from what place** there is a starting and moving:

+ in its proper sense, movement **away from**: 
	
	> `métima hrestallo círa` *leave the last shore*;

+ movement **out of** a container, often accompanied with a preposition `et`:
	
	> `Melko Mardello lende` *Melko has gone from Earth* [MQ: LR/72]<br>
	`et Eärello Endorenna utúlien` *out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I have come* [LotR/967]; 

+ **starting point** of movement:

	> `elenillor pella talta-taltala` *beyond stars falling* [MC/222]
	
+ **pointing, aiming** away from: `i hyarma tentane Melkorello` *the left hand pointed away from Melkor* [VT49/6];

	Verbs of **separation** from the whole take genitive I: `n·alalmino hyá lanta lasse` *from the elm-tree here a leaf falls* [EQ:VT40/8].
	
## Ablative of Source, Origin and Cause

In a more abstract sense with verbs of:

+ *taking, receiving from*: `yello camnelyes` *from whom you received him* [VT47/21];
+ *protecting, guarding, securing from*: `áme etelehta ulcullo` *deliver us from evil* [VT43/12];
+ *being afraid of* [VT44/7];

	<span style="font-size:12px; margin-left: 12px; padding-right:1px;">&bull;</span> *asking, wishing, learning from*;<br>
	<span style="font-size:12px; margin-left: 12px; padding-right:1px;">&bull;</span> *restraining, preventing, excluding from*;

!!! note
	Ablative of origin can also be used as an attributive modifier: `Menelluin Írildeo Gondolindello` *Cornflower of Idril from Gondolin* [TAI/193], `fanwen tollillon lómealloi` *a dream from the gloomy islands* [PE16/147]. Genitive I is more common in this role, however.
	
!!! tip
	From a common interpretation <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">causes are origins of events</span> arises the ablative of cause, describing the **cause, reason, motive by which** an action or an event came to be[^2].
	
## Ablative of Time

When denoting time, the ablative carries the meaning of **from, since, after**. Commonly it is attended by prepositions, as `et`: `et sillumello ter yénion yéni tenn' ambarmetta` *from this hour, through years of years until the ending of the world* [VT44/33], but it is possible to go with single ablative[^1].

### Ablative as Exessive

!!! tip

	As the opposite of translative, exessive denotes the *former state* or *shape*, out of which some other state or shape proceeds or is produced.

## As Obligatory Complement

### As Indirect Object

A few special verbs take second (indirect) object in ablative:

> `ávatyara mello roctammar` [VT43/11]. *Forgive us our trespasses*.
