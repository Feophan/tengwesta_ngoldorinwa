# Allative

The main function of the allative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the goal of the motion, generally pointing out *whither*.

## As a Direction of Movement

The allative describes a **general** directional goal of the movement. 

The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use **with** a specific spatial **static** adposition, like `nu` *under* (&rarr; TBD), emphasizes the particulars: 

> `lantaner Turcildi nuhuinenna` [LR/47]. *the Lordly Men fell under shadow*.<br>
	`enwina lúme elenillor pella talta-taltala` [MC/222]. *The old darkness beyond the stars falling*.
	
The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically, and a series of **directional** adpositions are used instead when the context is not complicit:

> `unlunke naiqe yu vaile·na ar elle ha men ambostuva` [EQ: PE16/146]. *He pulled his sword from the sheath and drove it into the breast*.

To provide some canonic examples:

1\. the allative describes the motion **into a containment**:

> `eari ullier i kilyanna` [LR/47]. *The seas poured into the chasm*.

2\. it denotes a **surface** a movement is directed towards and comes into direct
contact with:

> `Anar caluva tielyanna` [UT/22]. *The sun shall shine upon your path*.

3\. it signifies **entered dominion or territory**:

> `Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien` [LotR/967]. *Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth have I come*.

4\. and generally **the end point of a movement** or **intended destination**:

> `hríve úva véna` [PE22/167]. *Winter is drawing near to us*.<br>
	`quiquie menin coaryanna, arse` [VT49/24]. *Whenever I arrive at his house, he is out*.

5\. as well as the **target of aim**:

> `ar cé mo formenna tentanes Amanna` [VT49/8]. *And if (one turned face) northwards, it (left hand) pointed towards Aman*.

!!! warning
	Allative profiles the goal as the **intended destination**, but it does not specify whether this goal is reached or whether an agent is somewhere on the way. However, if the direction is **not** the goal, the allative cannot be used. To describe the directionality of the path, the adposition `na` *towards* is employed instead[^1]. 

## Allative of Time

In the domain of time, the use of the allative is restricted to those expressions where both the starting point and the endpoint are mentioned. For instance, if we want to say 'from Monday to Friday', we will use the allative as in `izilyallo valanyanna`, but if we just want to mention the endpoint, the use of the allative is not allowed; instead, the adposition `tenna` *until* is used. Therefore, *until tomorrow* is translated as `tenna enar`[^3]. 

## Allative of Purpose

!!! tip
	Extending the meaning of direction, allative also signifies the **purpose** of the action, following a frequent conceptualization: <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">causes are origins of events</span>, and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">purposes are destinations</span>: *let's go looking ****for food***[^2].
	
For the use of allative of purpose in periphrasic future construction &rarr; TBD.

### Allative as Translative

!!! tip
	Verbs of change like `óla`, `verya`, `aja` take allative to describe a final **state** or **result**: *he turned into a great scholar*.
	
## Allative of Extent

Similar to instrumental, allative can describe *how* an action was carried out, answering a question **to what extent? to what degree?**

> `a laita tárienna` [LotR/953]. *Praise (them) to the height*.

## As Obligatory Complement

### As Direct Object

Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in allative case: 

> `verya senna` [VT49/45]. *I married her*.<br>
	`Tar-Calion octacáre Valannar` [LR/47]. *Tar-Kalion warred the Powers*.

### As Indirect Object

Generally, dative denoting a recipient can be freely substituted for allative:

> `antane ninna` [PE17/147]. *He gave it to me*.<br>
	`sin quentë Quendingoldo Elendilenna` [PM/401]. *Thus Pengolodh said to Elendil*.

[^2]: `ortírielyanna rucimme` might be an example of such function ("we flee *for your protection*"), and the use of `ruce` with ablative to denote the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">cause</span> of fear does give some credibility to it. However, the Latin original *Sub tuum praesidium confugimus* has a metaphorical spatial sense 'under', hence the example cannot serve as a solid confirmation of such usage. But for typological and pragmatical reasons, as well as (weak) additional support by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">future</span> function, we suggest to keep it.
[^3]: Neither ablative nor allative are attested in temporal domain, but: "`na` *to, towards, of space/****time***" [PE17/147].
