# Genitive

The main function of the genitive is at the level of the noun phrase, to mark attributive modifiers (i.e. expressing various relations between (pro)nouns/noun phrases). It is also used to mark some required constituents (complements) with verbs/adjectives, and functions in a few adverbial expressions.

Quenya distinguishes two genitival cases: genitive I or **partitive** and genitive II or **adjective**[^1].

## As Modifier in a Noun Phrase: the Attributive Genitive

The genitive is used particularly within noun phrases, to mark a noun phrase or pronoun as modifier of a head (&rarr;26.18). Traditionally, many different categories within this attributive genitive use are distinguished; the most important of these are given below:

+ The **genitive of possession** denotes ownership, belonging, etc.;
+ The **genitive of origin** denotes the origin, offspring, source, etc. of the head;
+ With nouns that express an action ('action nouns', &rarr;23.6), the genitive is used for the subject or object of that action --- **genitive of the subject** (or 'subjective' genitive) or **of the object** (or 'objective' genitive);
+ Other relations between nouns: material/contents, price/value, elaboration, etc.

**Genitive of possession** distinguishes **alienable** (which can be given away or lost) and **inalienable** (perpetual and inherent to the head) possession. Concepts comprising inalienable possession include:

+ body parts: `rámar aldaron`, `hon maro`;
+ part-whole relations: `tyulma ciryo`, `aicasse Taniquetildo`;
+ kinship terms: `amille Hristo`, `indis i·ciryamo`;
+ various social relations: `ingwe ingweron`, `aran zindaron`;
+ attributes: `Vorondo voronwe`, `alcar Oromèo`;
+ products originating from the head: `yáve móno`, `óma tário`.

Generally these categories are expressed with genitive **partitive**, while the rest — alienable relations — with genitive **adjective**: `Vardava tellumar`, `róma Oroméva`.

**Genitive of origin** marks the location where the modifier originated from, or its creator (who might not be in its possession), or its author:

+ location: `Calaciryo míri`, `Eldar Malariando`;
+ creator: `róma Oromèo`, `i·coimas Eldaron`.

Genitive of origin is expressed with genitive **partitive**, but its locational function is complementary to **ablative**, particularly if the noun phrase already has a modifier in genitive of another function: `menelluin Írildeo Ondolindello`.

**Genitive of composition** describes the relation between two nouns as a part to its
whole:

+ material or substance: `yuldar miruvóreo`;
+ content: `parma mittarion`, `aure veryanwesto`;
+ individual elements: `yénion yéni`;
+ source: `astali hruo`.

**Genitive of subject**, marked by genitive I, denotes the subject of a verbal noun: `Túro matie masta`, `nero carie cirya`. Note that the action can sometimes be implicit: `Ráno tie` *path of the Moon* ('path *taken* by the Moon').

**Genitive of object** (genitive II) describes the affected patient of the action: `Nurtale Valinóreva`, `ciryava carie`. Note that **gerund** can take a direct **specific** object in accusative like a verb. In that case, the object **must follow**[^2] it: `carie cirya` *making of a (specific) ship*.

### Determiner Genitive and Descriptive Genitive

While the functions listed above are useful, in practice they don't cover a multitude of border cases which we label here as **descriptive**. Most grammars treat it as a homogenous category with only vaguely defined function, but we can distinguish a few categories within it, responsible for **naming**, **comparing** and **describing**: 

**Classifying genitives** are used to name certain objects, where the dependent clearly restricts the denotation of the head noun: `Nand' Gondoluncava`, `hwesta zindarinwa`, `Eruva lisse`.

Such genitive is semantically most closely related to adjectives and loose compounds: `farea nasto`, `meneldea Eru`, `Ambarmetta`, `Elennanóre`. Therefore it typically employs genitive II[^4].

**Metaphorical Genitive** is used to describe an object, experience, state etc. in terms of another one: `yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron`. Structurally these genitives behave like **determiner genitives** from before, but the dependent is very clearly not specific. They do not have the function of a typical determiner (i.e. the referential anchoring of a referent), but rather, they evoke a certain **typical property**.

In contrast to metaphorical genitives, **generic genitives** are not used to compare a referent in terms of another referent (or the referent’s properties) but to describe a specific referent by setting it in relation to **its kind**: `lambe Eldaron`.  

### Genitive II and Loose Compound[^3]

!!! tip
	Essentially, adjective genitive only differs from N + N sequences in containing the marker `-va`. There are two main factors determining the presence or absence of `-va` in N + N sequences (given that both allow for a possessive construal), i.e. the **animacy** and the **referentiality** of the dependent.
	
	Adjective genitive still contains some degree of referentiality, in any case more than in expressions with loose compounding. For this reason, `rácina [arquenwa macil]` is more likely to refer to a specific *knight* than `rácina [arquen macil]`.
	
	Furthermore, animate dependents are usually realized with the `-va`, while inanimate dependents prefer the loose construction. In many cases. however, animacy does not determine categorically whether a genitive or an N + N sequence is used, but rather the statistical preference (i.e. frequency) of the two constructions.
	
### Genitive Gradience

Gradience in grammar is usually characterized as the phenomenon of blurred boundaries between two categories. When it comes to genitive and the use of genitive I over genitive II, we distinguish two sources for gradience: gradience of the semantic features and gradience as a mismatch in the meaning–form mapping.

Gradience of the semantic features arises from natural ambiguity of some interpretations: 

> `Eldar Malariando` *the elves of (from) Beleriand* [genitive of origin] and `Eldar Malariandéva` *the Beleriand elves* [classifying genitive] are for all purposes the same.

The choice then comes as mostly esthetical, but some difference in meaning might still be implied:

> `yuldar miruvóreo` *draughts (made) of mead* [genitive of composition] and `yuldar miruvóreva` *mead draughts, draughts sweet like mead* [classifying or metaphorical genitive].

Mismatch mapping is a very late phenomenon when Quenya stopped being a colloquial language. It surfaced as a confusion between genitive I and II and consequent displacement of the latter.

!!! tip
	As a rule of thumb if you are in an muddy case where it is difficult to decide between genitive I or II, consider whether a dependent is conveying a reference (genitive I) or describing a property (genitive II):
	
	> `octe porceo` *an egg of (a specific) chicken*;	
	> `octe porceva` *a chicken egg (and not a duck egg)*.
