# Genitive

The main function of the genitive is at the level of the noun phrase, to mark attributive modifiers (i.e. expressing various relations between (pro)nouns/noun phrases). It is also used to mark some required constituents (complements) with verbs/adjectives, and functions in a few adverbial expressions.

Quenya distinguishes two genitival cases: genitive I or **partitive** and genitive II or **adjective**.

## As Modifier in a Noun Phrase: the Attributive Genitive

The genitive is used particularly within noun phrases, to mark a noun phrase or pronoun as modifier of a head (&rarr;26.18). Traditionally, many different categories within this attributive genitive use are distinguished; the most important of these are given below:

+ The **genitive of possession** denotes ownership, belonging, etc.;
+ The **genitive of origin** denotes the origin, offspring, source, etc. of the head;
+ With nouns that express an action ('action nouns', &rarr;23.6), the genitive is used for the subject or object of that action --- **genitive of the subject** (or 'subjective' genitive) or **of the object** (or 'objective' genitive);
+ Other relations between nouns: material/contents, price/value, elaboration, etc.;
+ The partitive genitive (also 'of the divided whole') denotes a whole to which the head
belongs as a part.

**Genitive of possession** distinguishes **alienable** (which can be given away or lost) and **inalienable** (perpetual and inherent to the head) possession. Concepts comprising inalienable possession include:

+ body parts: `rámar aldaron`, `hon maro`;
+ part-whole relations: `tyulma ciryo`, `aicasse Taniquetildo`;
+ kinship terms: `amille Hristo`, `indis i·ciryamo`;
+ various social relations: `ingwe ingweron`, `aran zindaron`;
+ attributes: `Vorondo voronwe`, `alcar Oromèo`;
+ products originating from the head: `yáve móno`, `óma tário`.

Generally these categories are expressed with genitive **partitive**, while the rest — alienable relations — with genitive **adjective**: `Vardava tellumar`, `róma Oroméva`.

**Genitive of origin** marks the location where the modifier originated from, or its creator (who might not be in its possession), or its author:

+ location: `Calaciryo míri`, `Eldar Malariando`;
+ creator: `róma Oromèo`, `i·coimas Eldaron`.

Genitive of origin is expressed with genitive **partitive**, but its locational function is complementary to **ablative**, particularly if the noun phrase already has a modifier in genitive of another function: `menelluin Írildeo Ondolindello`.

**Genitive of composition** describes the relation between two nouns as a part to its
whole:

+ material or substance: `yuldar miruvóreo`;
+ content: `parma mittarion`;
+ individual elements: `yénion yéni`;
+ source: `astali hruo`;
