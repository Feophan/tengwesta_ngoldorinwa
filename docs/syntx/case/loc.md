# Locative

The main function of the locative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the scene of the action, generally pointing out *where* or *when* the action is happening.

## Spatial Locative

The locative describes a **general** spatial relation. We can postulate the basing meaning as[^1]:

```text
The figure is located close to the ground.
```

The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use of a specific spatial adpositions, like `mi` *in* or `to` *on* (&rarr; TBD), emphasizes the particulars of the relation and can highlight any deviations from the default assumption, thus serving to cancel unwarranted implicatures:

```text
a. The figure is in contact with the ground.
b. The figure–ground relation is canonical.
c. The ground supports the figure against gravity.
```
	
The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically: *a plate* is **on** *a table* rather than **under** it, while *an apple* is **in** *a bowl* rather than **at** it.

To provide some examples:

1\. the locative conveys the notion of being within a containment:

> `i fairi néce ringa súmaryasse ve maiwi yaimie` [MC/222]. *The pale phantoms in her cold bosom like gulls wailing*.

2\. it denotes a surface, trodden or touched:

> `man tiruva rácina cirya gondolisse morne?` [MC/222]. *Who shall heed a broken ship on the dark rocks?*

3\. it signifies the dominion or territory:

> `Altariello nainie Lóriendesse` [RGEO/58]. *Galadriel’s lament in Lórien*.

4\. and the substance the locus is submerged into:

> `nicsi coitar nenesse` [PE22/125]. *Fish live in water*. 

## Locative of Circumstance

As the extenstion of this meaning, the locative often denotes the **circumstances**, under which the action comes to pass.

This kind of locative encompasses the **locative of time** as well as the **absolute locative** (TBD). 

### Locative of Time

The locative of time refers to a specific moment or period:

+ **at** which the event happens;
+ **by** which the event should happen.

> `qe e·kárie i kirya aldaryas, ni kauva kiryasta menelyas` [MQ: PE22/121]. *if he finishes the boat* ***by Monday***, *I shall be able to sail* ***on Wednesday***.

### Locative of Respect

The locative of respect may denote the **particular point of view** from which a statement is made. This occurs chiefly with adjectives but also with intransitive verbs, and in gloss can be substituted with *with regard to*:

> `i jarma ú ten ulca símaryassen` [VT49/6]. *the left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations*.

Such locative can be used for:

+ parts of the body: *pain in finger, blind in mind, smitten on the neck*;
+ qualities and attributes (nature, form, size, name, birth, number, etc.): *rival in appearance, two leagues in width*;
+ sphere in general: *terrible in battle, good in matters in which he is skilled*.

The instrumental of manner and genitive of quality are often nearly equivalent to the locative of respect: *men are good in nature; men are good by nature; men are of good nature*[^2].

### Locative of Manner

With abstract nouns locative of manner can be used periphrasically to describe the state:

> `hara máriesse` [PE17/162]. *Stay in happiness* (or: *stay happily*)<br>
	`alalye nattira arcandemmar sangiessemman` [VT44/8]. *Despise not our petitions in our necessities* (or: *done out of necessity*).

## As Obligatory Complement

Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in locative case: 

> `Heru órava omesse` [VT44/12]. *Lord, have mercy on us*.

[^1]: Where **figure** is the described noun or action, and **ground** is the locus.
[^2]: Such overlap doesn't seem problematic, as it similarly exists in Ancient Greek (Accusative and Dative of Respect), Latin (Ablative and Genitive of Quality) and Sanskrit (Ablative, Instrumental, Genitive and Locative), where those are concurrent idioms.
