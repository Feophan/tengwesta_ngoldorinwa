# Common

The common case combines functions of historically separate nominative and accusative cases.

## As Nominative for Obligatory Constituent with Verbs

The nominative is the case used for the **subject** of a finite verb (and any modifiers that agree with it, &rarr;27.7).

**Predicative complements** with **linking verbs** (&rarr;26.8) agree with their subject (&rarr;27.7), and thus also stand in the nominative.

## Other Uses of Nominative

The nominative is used with some most common **prepositions** as there default choice (&rarr;31).

The nominative is also used in bare **lists** (&rarr;26.29), including entries in dictionaries.

For the nominative used in **apposition to a sentence**, &rarr;27.14.

The nominative is also used as a **vocative**: in calls or summonses to attract the attention of a person nearby, or of a god; in addresses, to acknowledge or maintain contact with some person nearby.

!!! note
	When vocative stands in apposition to a noun, the case of that noun is applied, however.

## As Accusative for Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs)

The accusative is the standard case for the **direct object** with verbs which take an object (&rarr;26.3).

The following verbs (&rarr;26.12) take a direct object and a predicative complement that agrees with that object (and thus also stands in the accusative; this is often called a 'double accusative').

The accusative is also used in the **accusative-and-infinitive** (&rarr;51), the **accusative absolute** (&rarr;52) and **accusative-and-participle** constructions (&rarr;52).

## As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier)

Time **when**, or **within which**, is expressed by either locative or accusative:
