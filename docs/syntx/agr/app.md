# Apposition

An appositive (&rarr;26.24-5) **agrees in case** with the word it belongs to, but has **its own number and gender**:

> `Elainen tárin Periandion ar meldenya anyáran` [VT49/40]. *To Elaine, queen of Hobbits and my very old friend*.

An appositive to a possessive clitic stands in the case of the host:

> `coarya Olwe` [WJ/369]. *The house of him, Olwe*.

> `tintilar i·eleni ómaryo lírinen aire-tário` [RGEO/59]. *The stars twinkle in her voice’s song, of the holy queen*.
