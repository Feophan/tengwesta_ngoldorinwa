# Antecedent &mdash; Relative Pronoun

## Basic Rule

Rule 1: a relative pronoun agrees in number and gender with its antecedent, but its
case is determined by its syntactical function in the relative clause (for details, &rarr;50.8):

> `i·cirya ya círa` *the ship which is putting out to sea* (sg. inanim. as the antecedent, com. as subject in the relative clause)

> `i·nér yen antanes miquelis` *the man to who she gave a kiss* (sg. anim. as the antecedent, dat. as indirect object in the relative clause)

## Exceptions

The sense construction (&rarr;27.6) is possible with relative pronouns.

For other exceptions, especially 'relative repulsion', &rarr;50.13-14.
