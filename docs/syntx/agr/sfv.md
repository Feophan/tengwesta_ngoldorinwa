# Subject – Finite Verb

## Basic Rule

Rule 1: a finite verb agrees in **number** and **person** with its **subject**.

Rule 2: within a clause, **overt argument** noun phrases never appear with concording **personal affixes**[^1]:

`i·cirya círa` *the ship is setting out* (overt third person singular)

`i·ciryar círar` *the ships are setting out* (overt third person plural)

`círante` *they (ships) are setting out* (implicit third person plural)

## Exceptions

When the verb has an **covert object** and a **overt subject**, the objective inflection displaces agreement in number:

> `sív' emme apsenet tien i úcarir emmen` [VT43/12]. *As we forgive those who trespass against us*.
	
When a subject is **neutral group plural**, the verb can be singular:

> `i·oromandi tanna lende` [PE16/96]. *The wood-spirits came thither*.

The plural form of the verb may, however, be used to emphasize that the subject consists of various individual members:

> `Valar ar Maiar fantaner nassentar fanainen` [PE17/174]. *Valar and Maiar cloaked their true-being in veils*.

When there are **multiple subjects**, the verb will normally be plural. Sometimes, however, especially when the verb precedes a first singular subject, it may be singular:

> `sanome tarne Olórin, Aracorno, Eomer, Imrahil` [PE17/71]. *There stood Gandalf, Aragorn, Eomer and Imrahil*.

> `sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta` [LotR/967]. *In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world*.

The singular form may also be used with complex conjunctions, for examples \*`ú ... ú` *neither … nor*, particularly if nouns belong to the same grammatical gender:

`ú luime ú lúme hora úquen` (translation from GN: GL/53). *Neither flood nor time waits for anyone*.

The verb may agree in number with the subject in meaning rather than in grammatical
form: this is called the **sense construction** (Lat. *constructio ad sensum*, Q. *tanwe handesse*, 'according to sense'); for example, when the subject is singular but refers to a collective, the verb may be plural in form:

> `lie tatallaner i·már ampanaina` [VT49/43]. *While it was being built people marveled at the house*. `tatallaner` agrees with singular `lie` in plural.

[^1]: The only exception for the rule, `esse úpa nás` seems to be an echo of archaic word order. Whether it actually belongs to Quenya proper is debatable.
