# Head – Modifier (in Noun Phrases); Predicative Modifiers and Complements

## Basic Rule

Rule 1: an adjective, participle[^1] or adnominal pronoun agrees in **case** and **number** with the head it modifies.

Rule 2: only one eligible component of a noun phrase receives the case inflection:

`i·saila nér` *the wise man* (com. sg.)

`i·saile neri` *the wise men* (com. pl.)

`i·saile nerin` *to the wise men* (dat. pl. head-last)

`i·neri sailain` *to the wise men* (dat. pl. head-first)

!!! note
	Only some numerals decline: for indeclinable numerals, &rarr;9.2-5.
	
	Other types of modifiers do not agree with their head, particularly attributive genitive I, adverbs, cardinal numerals and prepositional phrases. For examples, &rarr;26.20.
	
## Exceptions

Modifier might not agree with its following head in **adverbial case**:

> `ono alye eterúna me illume ilya racsellor` [VT44/9]. *But deliver us always from all dangers*. `ilya` doesn’t agree with `racsellor` in number.

> `man tiruva cirya ondolisse morne` [MC/222]. *Who shall heed a ship on the dark rocks?* `morne` agrees with `ondolisse` in number.

Note that if *modifier* receives adverbial case inflection instead, it **agrees in number** with its head as usual:

> `anar púrea ticta acsor ilcalannar` [MC/222]. *The sun blinking on the gleaming bones*.

Modifier might not agree with its following head, if the noun phrase as a whole is a modifier in another noun phrase:

> `aran linta ciryalíva` [PE17/147]. *King of Swift Ships*.

A demonstrative pronoun or a qualifier which serves as subject to a linking verb and predicative noun ('this is X') may either agree with that noun, or appear in the neuter:

(13) `ilya sí maller raicar` [LR/47]. *Now all roads are bent*.

A noun in genitive II case usually behaves as an adjective, but might not agree with a head inflected for case or, in later use, if it takes on the role of genitive:

> `linte yuldar lisse miruvóreva` [RGEO/58]. *Swift draughts of the sweet mead*. `miruóreva` doesn’t agree with `yuldar` in number.

[^1]: Note that active la-participle doesn't have plural form.
