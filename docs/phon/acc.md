# Accentuation

Quenya accent is pitch-dynamic: the stressed syllable is pronounced louder and with higher pitch. It is limited (can only occur in specific positions) and is not lexical: the accent doesn't differentiate words like it does in English or Spanish.

## General Rule of Accentuation

### Possible Positions of the Accent; 'Long' and 'Short' Syllables

The main accent can only normally fall on one of the two syllables of a word:

+ the **penult**: the second-to-last syllable of a word (*x*-***x***-*x*);
+ the **antepenult**: the third-to-last syllable of a word (***x***-*x*-*x*).

Accentuation is determined strongly by the length of the penult syllable of a word. For the purposes of accentuation:

+ a syllable is long if it is closed, or contains a long vowel or a diphthong;
+ a syllable is short if it is open and contains a short vowel.

!!! note
	Such pairs as *ty, qu, hy, hw* can be considered as a single or a double consonant for this purpose.

For vowel quantity (long/short), &rarr; @@.

!!! important "Rule"
	**Rule 1**: The regular main stress falls on a **second mora** from the end, not counting the last syllable:
	
If the antepenult is long, it takes two morae:

+ closed syllable: `lótesse` --- *lo-[t*-***e****<sub>2</sub>-s<sub>1</sub>]-se*
+ long vowel: `untúpa` --- *un-[t*-***u****<sub>2</sub>-u<sub>1</sub>]-pa*
+ diphthong: `alasaila` --- *ala-[s*-***a****<sub>2</sub>-i<sub>1</sub>]-la*

If the antepenult is short, it takes one mora:

+ `termaruva` --- *ter-[****ma****<sub>2</sub>-ru<sub>1</sub>]-va*

Consequently, in words of one or two syllables the stress is always prototonic:

+ *[****e****<sub>1</sub>]-len*, *[****va****<sub>1</sub>]-la*, *[****o****<sub>2</sub>-o<sub>1</sub>]-re*

!!! important "Exceptions"
	**Exception 1**: If by Rule 1 the stress should fall on a **first vowel of hiatus**, the stress shifts forward:
	
	+ `Lómeanor` --- *'lo-****o****<sub>3</sub>-[me<sub>2</sub>-a<sub>1</sub>]-'nor*
	+ But naturally it didn't happen if the syllable was already initial: `tie` --- *'****ti****<sub>1</sub>-e*
	
	**Exception 2**: Weak nouns of second declension keep their stress pattern despite the lack of rhythmic lengthening (@@):
	
	+ `Orome` --- *['****o****<sub>2</sub>-ro<sub>1</sub>]-ˌme*; `Oromèo` --- *'o-[ro<sub>2</sub>-'****me****<sub>1</sub>]-o*
	
	**Exception 3**: Certain **prefixes** don't take on stress:
	
	+ `ovèa` --- *o-['****ve****<sub>1</sub>]-a*
	
	**Exception 4**: Recognized compounds kept independent stress position:
	
	+ `losselie` --- *los-se-['****li****<sub>1</sub>]-e* (not *los-['****se****<sub>2</sub>-li<sub>1</sub>]-e*)

### Secondary Stress

!!! important "Rule"
	**Rule 2**: The **secondary** stress is placed on **alternate** syllables in either direction from the main stress.
	
	**Rule 3**: Initial syllable received secondary stress:
	
	+ `ómaryo` --- *ˌ****o****-o-'****mar****-yo*
	
	**Rule 4**: Secondary stress that precedes the main stress and is separated from it by one or more syllables and is on either a) initial or b) long syllable is **strong**.
	
!!! important "Exceptions"
	**Exception 5**: The long syllable or initial syllable attracted secondary stress if they were separated from the main stress:
	
	+ `andafalasse` --- *'****an****-da-fa-['****la****<sub>2</sub>-s<sub>1</sub>]-se* (**not** *an-****da****-fa-****las****-se* as per Rule 2)
	
	**Exception 6**: If the initial syllable was light and immediately preceded the main stress, it lost its accent:
	
	+ `namárie` --- *na-['ma-****a****<sub>2</sub>-ri<sub>1</sub>]-e*

### Tone

In isolation, the main stress is always marked with a high tone. The secondary stress was lower, when equally strong, and low otherwise:

+ *fal˦-ma˧-lin˥-nar˧*
+ *an˩-[du-u]˥-ne˧*

## Rhythmic Lengthening

After historic stress shift (@@), the Quenya accent got fixed. As a result, in some inflections to preserve the prosodic pattern, the vowel bearing the secondary accent lengthened and took the main accent instead:

+ *I'lúvaˌtar --- I'lúva'táro* (not \**'Ilú'vataˌro*)
+ *'máriˌe --- 'mári'éno* (not \**ˌmá'rieˌno*)
+ *'tuluˌva --- 'tulu'váse* (not \**tu'luvaˌse*)

Sometimes, for example in weak nouns of first or second declension, it happened even when the syllable of secondary stress would receive the main stress by the general rule. Colloquially, those were shortened:

+ *'ilduˌma --- 'ildu'máron* or *'ildu'maron*

The only notabe exception to this is genitive of penult-stressed words in partitive plural (@@). By *Exception 1*, the main accent shifts forward from *li*:

+ *'mali'norne --- 'mali'norneˌli --- 'malinor'nélion* or *'malinor'nelion* (not \**'maliˌnorne'líon*)
