# Accentuation

Quenya accent is pitch-dynamic: the stressed syllable is pronounced louder and with higher pitch. It is limited (can only occur in specific positions) and is not lexical: the accent doesn't differentiate words like it does in English or Spanish.

## General Rule of Accentuation

### Possible Positions of the Accent; 'Long' and 'Short' Syllables

The main accent can only normally fall on one of the two syllables of a word:

+ the **penult**: the second-to-last syllable of a word (*x*-***x***-*x*);
+ the **antepenult**: the third-to-last syllable of a word (***x***-*x*-*x*).

Accentuation is determined strongly by the length of the penult syllable of a word. For the purposes of accentuation:

+ a syllable is long if it is closed, or contains a long vowel or a diphthong;
+ a syllable is short if it is open and contains a short vowel.

For vowel quantity (long/short), &rarr; @@.

!!! important "Rule"
	The regular main stress falls on a second mora from the end, not counting the last syllable:
	
If the antepenult is long, it takes two morae:

+ closed syllable: `lótesse` --- *lo-[t*-***e****<sub>2</sub>-s<sub>1</sub>]-se*
+ long vowel: `untúpa` --- *un-[t*-***u****<sub>2</sub>-u<sub>1</sub>]-pa*
+ diphthong: `alasaila` --- *ala-[s*-***a****<sub>2</sub>-i<sub>1</sub>]-la*

If the antepenult is short, it takes one mora:

+ `termaruva` --- *ter-[****ma****<sub>2</sub>-ru<sub>1</sub>]-va*

Consequently, in words of two syllables the stress is always prototonic:

+ *[****e****<sub>1</sub>]-len*, *[****va****<sub>1</sub>]-la*, *[****o****<sub>2</sub>-o<sub>1</sub>]-re*

### Exceptions to General Rule

If by general rule the stress should fall on a first vowel of hiatus, the stress shift forward. Naturally, it doesn't happen if it is already the initial syllable:

+ `Lómeanor` --- *lo-****o****<sub>3</sub>-[me<sub>2</sub>-a<sub>1</sub>]-nor*
