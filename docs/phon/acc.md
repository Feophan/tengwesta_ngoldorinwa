# Accentuation

>[!TLDR] To-do
>+ [ ] Find reference to finally-stressed imperatives

Quenya accent is pitch-dynamic: the stressed syllable is pronounced louder and with higher pitch. It is limited (can only occur in specific positions) and is not lexical: the accent doesn't differentiate words like it does in English or Spanish.

## General Rule of Accentuation

### Possible Positions of the Accent; 'Long' and 'Short' Syllables

The main accent can only normally fall on one of the two syllables of a word:

+ the **penult**: the second-to-last syllable of a word (*x*-***x***-*x*);
+ the **antepenult**: the third-to-last syllable of a word (***x***-*x*-*x*).

Accentuation is determined strongly by the length of the penult syllable of a word. For the purposes of accentuation:

+ a syllable is long if it is closed, or contains a long vowel or a diphthong;
+ a syllable is short if it is open and contains a short vowel.

>[!NOTE]
>Such pairs as *ty, qu, hy, hw* can be considered as a single or a double consonant for this purpose[<sup>a</sup>](notes/acc/acc_kw.md).

For vowel quantity (long/short), &rarr; [{{ch.p.sou}}.7](sou.md#1.7).

### Penultimate Law

>[!RULE] Rule 1
>The regular main stress falls on a **second mora** from the end, not counting the last syllable.

If the antepenult is long, it takes two morae:

+ closed syllable: `lótesse` — *lo-\[t*-***e****<sub>2</sub>-s<sub>1</sub>\]-se*
+ long vowel: `untúpa` — *un-\[t*-***u****<sub>2</sub>-u<sub>1</sub>\]-pa*
+ diphthong: `alasaila` — *ala-\[s*-***a****<sub>2</sub>-i<sub>1</sub>\]-la*

If the antepenult is short, it takes one mora:

+ `termaruva` — *ter-\[****ma****<sub>2</sub>-ru<sub>1</sub>\]-va*

Consequently, in words of one or two syllables the stress is always prototonic:

+ *\[****e****<sub>1</sub>\]-len*, *\[****va****<sub>1</sub>\]-la*, *\[****o****<sub>2</sub>-o<sub>1</sub>\]-re*

#### Exceptions

>[!WARNING] Exception 1
>A word was stressed on the last syllable if it was:
>
>+ a verb in imperative (@@): `quetá` — *kwe-'****ta***
>+ a functor on `-ai`: `cenai` — *ke-'****naj***

>[!WARNING] Exception 2
>If by Rule 1 the stress should fall on a **first vowel of hiatus**, the stress shifts forward[<sup>b</sup>](notes/acc/acc_e2.md):
>
>+ `Lómeanor` — *'lo-****o****<sub>3</sub>-\[me<sub>2</sub>-a<sub>1</sub>\]-'nor*
>+ But naturally it didn't happen if the syllable was already initial: `tie` — *'****ti****<sub>1</sub>-e*

>[!WARNING] Exception 3
>Weak nouns of second declension keep their stress pattern despite the lack of rhythmic lengthening (@@)[<sup>c</sup>](notes/acc/acc_e3.md):
>
>+ `Orome` — *\['****o****<sub>2</sub>-ro<sub>1</sub>]-ˌme*; `Oromèo` — *'o-\[ro<sub>2</sub>-'****me****<sub>1</sub>\]-o*

>[!WARNING] Exception 4
>Certain **prefixes** don't take on stress[<sup>d</sup>](notes/acc/acc_e4.md):
>
>+ `ovèa` — *o-\['****ve****<sub>1</sub>\]-a*

>[!WARNING] Exception 5
>Recognized compounds kept independent stress position[<sup>e</sup>](notes/acc_acc_e5.md):
>
>+ `losselie` — *los-se-\['****li****<sub>1</sub>\]-e* (not *los-\['****se****<sub>2</sub>-li<sub>1</sub>\]-e*)

### Secondary Stress

>[!RULE] Rule 2
>The **secondary** stress is placed on **alternate** syllables in either direction from the main stress[<sup>f</sup>](notes/acc?acc_r2.md).
>
>+ `Calaciryanen` — *ˌ****ca****-la-'****cir****-ya-ˌ****nen***

>[!RULE]	Rule 3
>Initial syllable received secondary stress[<sup>c</sup>](note/acc/acc_e3.md):
>
>+ `ómaryo` — *ˌ****o****-o-'****mar****-yo*

>[!RULE]	Rule 4
>Secondary stress that precedes the main stress and is separated from it by one or more syllables and is on either a) initial or b) long syllable is **strong**[<sup>g</sup>](notes/acc/acc_r4.md).
>
>+ `oromardi` — *'****o****-ro-'****mar****-di*

>[!WARNING] Exception 6
>The long syllable or initial syllable attracted secondary stress if they were separated from the main stress[<sup>h</sup>](notes/acc/acc_e6.md):
>
>+ `andafalasse` — *'****an****-da-fa-\['****la****<sub>2</sub>-s<sub>1</sub>\]-se* (**not** *an-****da****-fa-****las****-se* as per Rule 2)

>[!WARNING] Exception 7
>If the initial syllable was light and immediately preceded the main stress, it lost its accent[<sup>i</sup>](notes/acc/acc_e7.md):
>
>+ `namárie` — *na-\['ma-****a****<sub>2</sub>-ri<sub>1</sub>\]-e*

## Tone

In isolation, the main stress is always marked with a high tone. The secondary stress was lower, when equally strong, and low otherwise[<sup>j</sup>](notes/acc/acc_tone.md):

+ *fal˦-ma˧-lin˥-nar˧*
+ *an˩-\[du-u\]˥-ne˧*

## Rhythmic Lengthening { id=rhl }

After historic stress shift (@@), the Quenya accent got fixed. As a result, in some inflections to preserve the prosodic pattern, the vowel bearing the secondary accent lengthened and took the main accent instead:

+ *I'lúvaˌtar — I'lúva'táro* (not \**'Ilú'vataˌro*)
+ *'máriˌe — 'mári'éno* (not \**ˌmá'rieˌno*)
+ *'tuluˌva — 'tulu'váse* (not \**tu'luvaˌse*)

The only notable exception to this is genitive of paroxytone words in partitive plural (@@). By *Exception 1*, the main accent shifts forward from *li*:

+ *'mali'norne — 'mali'norneˌli — 'malinor'néliˌon* or *'malinor'neliˌon* (not \**'maliˌnorne'líon*)

In that case, the lengthened vowel would be stressed even by the general rule. Colloquially, it shortened:

+ *'vaniˌma — 'vani'máliˌon* or *'vani'maliˌon*
