# On 'Calabrian' System

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Qenya Phonology</span> provides a few notes on pronunciation: 

!!! quote "PE12/8-9"
	... **ĭ**, as in English *pit*, is open but **ī** is close ...<br>
	... **ĕ** was open and **ē** somewhat closer ...<br>
	... **ā** is slightly farther back (like *a* in English *part*) ...<br>
	... **ŏ** is open, **ō** medium close ...<br>
	... **ŭ** open, but not so open as in English *put*, being rounder. **ū** close round.

The continued existence of such difference is hinted by this note in TQ2:

!!! quote "PE18/83"
	The situation in CQ is not known, but certainly in Eldarin the long vowels *ī, ē, ō, ū* tended to be tenser and narrower than the short vowels *ĭ, ĕ, ŏ, ŭ*.
	
which is taken here to ultimately support the 'Calabrian' system as the pronunciation system of choice.

### On ɛ — e and ɔ — o Mergers

!!! quote "AppE (I)"
	long é and ó were, when correctly pronounced, as by the Eldar, tenser and 'closer' than the short vowels.

!!! quote "PE19/106"
	CE open **ę̄** and close **ē** became merged in *ē*.<br>
	CE open Q and close **ō** became merged in *ō*.<br>
	¶ These sounds Q *ē, ō* were and remained of middle quality, neither very tense and close nor very slack and open.
