# On Palatal Stop

>[!QUOTE] PE22/66 (6)
>*t* in **ty** is the 'front explosive' \[c\], as e.g. Hungarian *ty*; but it is followed by an appreciable partly unvoiced *y*-offglide. This is more marked medially (where *ty* counts as a group); less so initially.

>[!QUOTE] LotR AppE (I)
>TY represents a sound probably similar to the *t* in English *tune*. It was derived mainly from *c* or *t+y*. The sound of English *ch*, which was frequent in Westron, was usually substituted for it by speakers of that language.

>[!QUOTE] PE13/63
>In sound it is now a very forward palatal stop foll\[owed\] by a distinct *y* off-glide; in some dialects it is practically E\[nglish\] *ch* with or without a clear *y* off-glide.

>[!QUOTE] PE14/41
>**ty**: is a very fronted 'k' or palatalised 't' followed by a fairly distinct 'y'-glide
