# On HY and HW

## On HY

>[!QUOTE] LotR AppE
>HY has the same relation to *y* as HW to *w*, and represents a sound like that often heard in English *hew, huge*; *h* in Quenya *eht, iht* had the same sound.

>[!QUOTE] PE19/75 (ii)
>**khy** became first \[χy\] with voiceless *y* and marked fronting of the \[χ\]. The result already in PQ was initially and medially a strong voiceless *y* \[ꜧ\], here transcribed *hy*, similar to, but more frictional than the initial sound in English *huge*.
>
>In Vanyarin this sound became \[š\] as English *sh*, and those among the Noldor who adopted the V. rhotacism (see above) also imitated this feature of Vanyarin. It did not, however, become a feature of Noldorin TQ.

>[!QUOTE] PE22/65 (5)
>**hy** is an audibly spirantal voiceless *y*, that is approximately \[ç\] as *ch* in German *ich*. 

## On HW

>[!QUOTE] LotR AppE
>HW is a voiceless *w*, as in English *white* (in northern pronunciation). 

>[!QUOTE] PE19/75 (2.ii)
>**khw** became first \[χw\] with unvoiced *w*. Parallel to the development of *khy* this became in PQ a spirantal voiceless *w* \[ƕ\]. It was more tense with closer lip-aperture and more friction than the voiceless *wh* of English. This combination was in CE rare medially, but not uncommon initially. It is here transcribed *hw*.
>
>In later Vanyarin pronunciation *hw* became *f*, but remained distinct from *f* in Noldorin and in the Exilic TQ.

>[!QUOTE] PE22/65 (5)
>**hw** is similarly and audibly spirantal voiceless *w*, that is \[ƕ\] as in English *wh* in *white* (in certain varieties of pronunciation).
