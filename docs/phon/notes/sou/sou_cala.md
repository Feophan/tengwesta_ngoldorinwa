# On 'Calabrian' System

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Qenya Phonology</span> provides a few notes on pronunciation: 

>[!QUOTE] PE12/8-9
>+ **ĭ**, as in English *pit*, is open but **ī** is close ...
>+ **ĕ** was open and **ē** somewhat closer ...
>+ **ā** is slightly farther back (like *a* in English *part*) ...
>+ **ŏ** is open, **ō** medium close ...
>+ **ŭ** open, but not so open as in English *put*, being rounder. **ū** close round.

The continued existence of such difference is hinted by this note in TQ2:

>[!QUOTE] PE18/83
>The situation in CQ is not known, but certainly in Eldarin the long vowels *ī, ē, ō, ū* tended to be tenser and narrower than the short vowels *ĭ, ĕ, ŏ, ŭ*.

which is taken here to ultimately support the 'Calabrian' system as the pronunciation system of choice.

### On ɛ — e and ɔ — o Mergers

>[!QUOTE] AppE (I)
>long é and ó were, when correctly pronounced, as by the Eldar, tenser and 'closer' than the short vowels.

>[!QUOTE] PE19/106
>+ CE open **ę̄** and close **ē** became merged in *ē*.
>+ CE open Q and close **ō** became merged in *ō*.
>+ These sounds Q *ē, ō* were and remained of middle quality, neither very tense and close nor very slack and open.
