# On Sibilants

## On S

The aspiration appeared was described both in OP1 and OP2:

>[!QUOTE] PE22/65 (3)
>**s** is not strictly homorganic with the other dentals, but is now whatever its origins (these are various) the normal *s*, a voiceless 'blade' consonant, with the blade of the tongue in contact (and so possessing an *i*-timbre), but with the point touching the lower teeth. It has no tendency, even before \[i\] to palatalization to \[š\] or \[ç\].

## On TH

The aspiration appeared was described both in OP1 and OP2:

>[!QUOTE] PE19/71 (3.ii)
>**th** became the interdental spirant \[þ\], more or less identical with the sound of *th* in English *thin*.

>[!QUOTE] AppE
>TH represents the voiceless *th* of English in *thin cloth*.

>[!QUOTE] VT41/7-8
>This in Quenya was earlier, as it remained in Vanyarin, a *dental* spirant (made with the tongue-tip behind the back of the upper front teeth, which makes the passage to *s* easier). \[...\] The shift from dental and labial *þ* and *f* to interdental *þ* and labio-dental *f* occurred first in Telerin. \[...\] Why the Ñoldor did not then proceed to adopt the interdental *þ* and so clarify the distinction between *þ* and *s* remains uncertain. \[...\] the T-series had two voiceless spirants allied to it, *s* and dental *þ* (somewhat similar) \[...\] in times of peace and calm thought the loremasters would no doubt have prevailed and the change to interdental *þ* have been accepted.
