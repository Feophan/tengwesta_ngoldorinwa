# On Palatal Stop

!!! quote "PE22/66 (6)"
	*t* in **ty** is the 'front explosive' \[c\], as e.g. Hungarian *ty*; but it is followed by an appreciable partly unvoiced *y*-offglide. This is more marked medially (where *ty* counts as a group); less so initially.

!!! quote "LotR AppE (I)"	
	TY represents a sound probably similar to the *t* in English *tune*. It was derived mainly from *c* or *t+y*. The sound of English *ch*, which was frequent in Westron, was usually substituted for it by speakers of that language.

!!! quote "PE13/63"	
	In sound it is now a very forward palatal stop foll\[owed\] by a distinct *y* off-glide; in some dialects it is practically E\[nglish\] *ch* with or without a clear *y* off-glide.

!!! quote "PE14/41"		
	**ty**: is a very fronted 'k' or palatalised 't' followed by a fairly distinct 'y'-glide
