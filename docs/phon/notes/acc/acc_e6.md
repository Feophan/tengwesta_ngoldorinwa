# Exception 6

>[!QUOTE] PE19/58
>But in normal long words, especially those made with derivative suffixes etc., the secondary accent was attracted by a long syllable (not adjacent to stress), and *never* fell on a *short* final syllable. A **strong secondary** accent was borne by a *long* syllable separated from the main (a) by *one* syllable, long or short: types *màndălḗ*{.ipa}, *kártastā̀*{.ipa}; or (b) by two syllables: type *kárpalimā̀*{.ipa}. A **weak secondary** was borne by the furthest of a series of two or three short syllables that *preceded* the *main*, types *àlakánda*{.ipa}, *kằlŭmălánda*{.ipa}, *kằlŭmălṓ*{.ipa}.

>Note that a long syllable adjacent to the stress did not attract the secondary, so *èrĕmăloitḗ*{.ipa}.

Note that this paragraph talks about CE stress before the Quenya stress shift. However, we assume that the logic of secondary stress placement stays the same:

>[!QUOTE] PE19/60
>The **secondary stresses** were usually reorganized and governed by the main stress; but on same principles as those described above for the archaic period --- except that a secondary accent (often\[?\] with low tone) could stand on an initial syllable immediately before a long main stress, as in *cṑmallo*{.ipa} above.
