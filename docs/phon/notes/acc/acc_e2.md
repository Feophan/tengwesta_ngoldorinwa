# Exception 2

>[!QUOTE] PE12/26-27
>In quadrisyllables and more the stress (chief) can never go farther back than three syllables, except in one case, that of quadrisyllables where the two internal syllables *consist of 2 short vowels in hiatus*. This is also the only case where a short final vowel bears a strong secondary stress. *Areanor* is accented **Áreanòr**, but *Areanóre* is accented **Àreanóre**.

This is contradicted by an early draft on Eldarin accent:

>But before the development of the Parmaquesta the main stress became fixed. It then fell on the **penultimate** syllable, when that was *long*; where it was *short*, the main stress fell on the **ante**-**penult**. It never fell further back, nor did it fall on final syllables other than monosyllabic words.

But stating that it *never* falls outside of the main rule would mean a rejection of Exception 1, of which we know the imperative must be stressed finally.
