# Rule 3 & Exception 7

>[!QUOTE] RGEO/60-61
>The initial syllable usually retained some degree of stress. In long words, especially recognized compounds, it was, though lower in tone, often equal in force to the main stress: as in *óromárdi*, *fálmalínnar*, etc. It was weaker when immediately preceding the main stress, as in *Àndū́ne*{.ipa}, *ṑmáryo*{.ipa}, *Tìntálle*{.ipa}, *Rṑméllo*{.ipa}; and in such cases, if it was short it became unstressed, as in *avā́niër*{.ipa}.
