# Tone

Two quotes contradict each other.

>[!QUOTE] RGEO/60
>The initial syllable usually retained some degree of stress. In long words, especially recognized compounds, it was, though lower in tone, often equal in force to the main stress.

>[!QUOTE] PE19/61
>In *Tarquesta* pronunciation the highest tone-pitch also accompanies as a rule the main stress in words pronounced 'normally', sc. in isolation, or in circumstances where no special significant tonal modifications were required. An exception to this rule is provided by long words, especially compounds, in which a very strong secondary accent fell on the initial syllable, while the actual main stress fell later (often on a derivative syllable). In such cases the initial secondary was in normal circumstances higher in pitch than the succeeding main stress \[...\]
>
>The TQt. tonal range is large, and its verbal and sentence tone-patterns are numerous; while stress is not excessive, and the **quality** of unstressed vowels is clear and not obscured. \[...\]
>
>Even where a syllable that in the Primitive period bore the main accent now still bears a strong secondary stress that syllable as a rule is lower in tone than the main stress --- except in the case observed above, of a strong secondary stress on an initial stem-syllable; but the high tone on the secondary in those cases is due not to ancient accent but to contemporary feeling for the special significance of the initial syllable.
