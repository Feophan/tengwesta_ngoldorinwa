>A long syllable in PQ, TQ is a syllable that contains (a) a long vowel, (b) a diphthong, (c) a vowel followed by *any two* (or more) consonants, including *ty, hy, kw, hw*.

On the other hand:

>[!QUOTE] PE19/65 (ft. 166)
>The penult was **long** and bore the accent when it contained (a) a long vowel, (b) a diphthong, (c) a vowel + any two consonants {other than >> \[in pencil\]} including originally *ty-, q, hw, hy*.
>
>The only places of doubt are therefore in cases of *ty, q* {occas\[ionally\] *hw, hy*,} since these are sometimes reductions after accent-fixing of *tty, kkw*. The inflexional pronouns -*tye*, -*qe* are short. So *kàritye*, *kàriqe*.

>[!QUOTE] PE19/88
>Whereas initially *hy*, *hw* were simple, i.e. short or of normal consonantal duration, medially, being derived from two consonants, they remained long in PQ, and a vowel before them was held to constitute a metrically long syllable. This was sometimes shown by prefixing <span class="tengwar">\`</span> \[= h\] to the normal letter. Thus <span class="tengwar">{</span> = initial *hw* \[ƕ\], <span class="tengwar">\`{</span> = *hw* medial \[ƕ̄\]. In TQ the length was reduced.
