## On Pronunciation

### Vowels

1. [LotR AppE]: "That is, the sounds were approximately those represented by *i, e, a, o, u* in English 'machine', 'were' {supposedly, as in *werewolf*}, 'father', 'for', 'brute', irrespective of quantity".
{: .pm #opv.a}
1. [LotR AppE]: "In Quenya long `é` and `ó` were, when correctly pronounced, as by the Eldar, tenser and 'closer' than the short vowels".
{: .pm #opv.b}
1. [PE12/8]: "`ĭ`, as in English *pit*, is open but `ī` is close".
{: .pm #opv.c}
1. [PE12/9]: "`ĕ` was open and `ē` somewhat closer, though open before `r`".
{: .pm #opv.d}
1. [PE12/9]: "`ā` is slightly farther back (like *a* in English *part*)".
{: .pm #opv.e}
1. [PE12/9]: "`ŏ` is open, `ō` medium close, but open before `r`".
{: .pm #opv.f}
1. [PE12/9]: "(1) `ŭ` open, but not so open as in English *put* {note that English *u* is <span class="ipa">[ʊ̜]</span>}, being rounder. (2) `ū` close round".
{: .pm #opv.g}
1. [PE18/83]: "certainly in Eldarin the long vowels <i>ī, ē, ō, ū</i> tended to be tenser and narrower than the short vowels <i>ĭ, ě, ŏ, ŭ</i>".
{: .pm #opv.h}
1. [PE19/96]: "the nasality being still retained in Noldorin".
{: .pm #opv.i}
1. [LotR AppE]: "All these diphthongs were falling diphthongs, that to stressed on the first element, and composed of the simple vowels run together. Thus *ai, ei, oi, ui* are intended to be pronounced respectively as the vowels in English *rye* (not *ray*), *grey, boy, ruin*: and *au* as in *loud, how* and not as in *laud, haw*".
{: .pm #opv.j}
1. [PE19/107]: "In both TQ and spoken V. the pronunciation of `iu` as `i̯ū` is usual".
{: .pm #opv.k}

### Consonants

1. [PE19/87 (ii.a)]: "After the opening of the simple aspirates to spirants, the voiceless stops became lightly aspirated (as in English), especially initially and when lengthened".
{: .pm #opc.a}
1. [PE19/89 (ftn 101)]: "The aspirates and voiceless stops (which were lightly aspirated in Quenya initially and after r, l, m, n, ñ) coalesced".
{: .pm #opc.b}
1. [PE19/86 (h)]: "After consonants other than s, *p, t, k* were strengthened and lightly aspirated".
{: .pm #opc.c}
1. [PE19/83 (vii)]: "Before *s* the aspiration was lost […]. In other cases the two varieties coalesced in stops with a weak aspiration".
{: .pm #opc.d}
1. {There is a contradiction in an earlier note} [PE22/65 (1)]: "The voiceless stops are explosive (as in modern English), but not aspirated".
{: .pm #opc.e}
1. [PE22/65 (1)]: "Their force is slightly greater immediately before a stressed vowel".
{: .pm #opc.f}
1. [PE19/84 (2.i.b)]: "In later (post-exilic) Quenya this `ɸt` seems usually to have been pronounced `u̯t` with partly unvoiced `u̯`".
{: .pm #opc.g}
1. [PE19/65 (2)]: "The 'dentals' *t, d, n, l, r* are 'point' consonants, but made as in English just behind the teeth".
{: .pm #opc.h}
1. [LotR AppE]: "`c` has always the value of *k* even before *e* and *i*".
{: .pm #opc.i}
1. [PE19/71 (3.iii)]: "It was not markedly fronted by adjacent front vowels *e, i*, at least no more than the corresponding stop *k*".
{: .pm #opc.j}
1. [PE19/84 (2.i.b)]: "This had become *ht*, in which *h* was a fairly strong spirant, in the spoken language of both Vanyar and Noldor before the Exile".
{: .pm #opc.k}
1. [LotR AppE]: "TY represents a sound probably similar to the *t* in English *tune*".
{: .pm #opc.l}
1. [PE22/66 (6)]: "*t* in *ty* is the 'front explosive' [c], as e.g. Hungarian *ty*; but it is followed by an appreciable partly unvoiced *y*-offglide. This is more marked medially (where *ty* counts as a group); less so initially".
{: .pm #opc.m}
1. [LotR AppE]: "QU has been used for *cw*".
{: .pm #opc.n}
1. [PE22/66 (9)]: "q (kw) consists of a lip-rounded *k̊* followed by a partly unvoiced *w*-offglide (more marked medially than initially)".
{: .pm #opc.o}
1. [PE19/71 (3.iii)]: "Many among the Exiles restored the sound [þ] [...] This was done chiefly in reciting or reading aloud matter written in PQ. In the actual use of the TQ as a spoken language *s* for *þ* remained characteristic of the Noldor".
{: .pm #opc.p}




"s is […] the normal s, a voiceless 'blade' consonant, with the blade of the tongue in contact (and so possessing an i-timbre), but with the point touching the lower teeth". [PE22/65 (3)]
In the sequence hty h was fronted. In N. pronunciation ity and hty closely resembled one another.
It was not markedly fronted by adjacent front vowels e, i, at least no more than the corresponding stop k
