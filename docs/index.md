This is a compilation of grammatical notes, intended as a reference for the project of translating *Alice in Wonderland* to Quenya in a consistent manner.
 I have accumulated a notable amount of notes by now, and switching to this format will facilitate their maintenance and accessibility. For now only a few notes are added, but the rest will slowly be transferred as well. But even the notes-composition phase is far from being over.
 
As such, it is not intended as a textbook: a user is expected to know and understand basic material. For beginner-friendly course, you should look into [Atanquesta](https://middangeard.org.uk/atanquesta/).

This pages also do not provide an overview or a discussion of canon material or its evolution, at least not at its core. For that you need to refer to [eldamo](https://eldamo.org/index.html).

Instead it aims to present a consistent system, which tries to come close to Quenya as described by Tolkien, but cannot do so due to the ever-changing and unfinished nature of this language. Thus it is inherently a **Neo-Quenya** grammar, and can't be 'more' or 'less' correct than other grammars out there.

Since the main goal of this grammar is to be used as a reference for a *specific project*, it also reflects *my* preferences and decisions I make along the way (which might also change in time as a result of a feedback). I try to provide some necessary background information to ensure these decisions are educated, and usually mention some conflicting but equally valid ideas in footnotes. But it is not the purpose of the site to ensure the given information is exhaustive of all the current opinions in Neo-Quenya. Therefore, take it with a grain of salt, but above all &mdash; be consistent.
