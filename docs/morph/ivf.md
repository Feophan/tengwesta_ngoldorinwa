## Basic Categories and Elements

### Categories of the Verb

#### Finite versus Non-finite Verb Forms

Quenya verb forms are either **finite** (indicatives, subjunctives, optatives, imperatives) or **non-finite** (gerunds, infinitives, participles, and verbal adjectives in `-nwa`, `-ite` or `-ima`). Finite verbs can have a personal ending (@@) and express person or number, and can be modified by mood particles; nonfinite verbs do not have a personal ending and do not express person or mood.

#### Categories Pertaining to All Verb Forms: Tense-Aspect

All Quenya verb forms, i.e. both finite and non-finite forms (only participles), are marked for the category of **tense-aspect**.

**Tense-aspect**: Quenya verb forms fall into three overarching systems, depending on which stem of the verb is used (@@); these three systems differ primarily in their expression of aspect:

+ the **aorist-stem system**, covering the aorist, the preterite, the future, present active and passive participles;
+ the **present-stem system**, covering the present and the imperfect;
+ and the **perfect-stem system**, covering the perfect, the past active and passive participles.

Within these systems, **tense** is expressed by all forms. Aspect is not expressed by participles.

#### Categories Pertaining to Finite Verb Forms

All finite verb forms, in addition to belonging to one of the three tense-aspect systems, are also marked for the categories of **person** and **number**, and the category of **mood**.

Finite verb forms express one of the following **persons**:

+ **apersonal form** (used with expressed subject, @@);
+ **first person** ('I'/'we (but not you)'/'we (with you)');
+ **second person** ('you');
+ or **third person**('he/she'/'it', 'they');

And they express one of the following **numbers**:

+ **singular** ('I', 'you', 'he/she'/'it');
+ **plural** ('we (but not you)'/'we (with you)', 'you', 'they');
+ in addition, Quenya has a **dual number** ('you and I', 'you two','the two of them', @@).

Finite verb forms do not express **moods**, and those are realized as mood particles preceeding the verb (for the uses and meanings of these moods, @@). The following moods are recongnized:

+ **indicative**;
+ **subjunctive**;
+ **optative**;
+ **imperative**.

Finally, indicative forms can be split into **basic forms** (aorist, present, preterite, imperfect, perfect, future) and **derivative forms** (future perfect, future imperfect, long perfect (perfect continuous), pluperfect, future-in-the-past).

!!! danger "Controversial"
	Derivative forms are extremely rare and should be avoided.

#### Categories Pertaining to Non-finite Verb Forms

Non-finite verb forms are marked for the following categories:

+ **Infinitives** are not marked for any category;
+ **Gerunds** are marked for case;
+ **Participles** express tense-aspect and voice, and, like adjectives, are also marked
for the categories of case (passive participles are also marked for number, @@);
+ **Verbal adjectives** are only marked for the categories of case, number and voice.

**Voice**: all Quenya participle forms also express voice, treated in detail in @@. A basic two way distinction between different kinds of forms may be made:

+ **active** forms;
+ and **passive** forms.

### Morphological Building Blocks: Stems, Endings, and Other Markings

#### Verb Stems and Tense-Aspect Stems

All forms of a certain verb share a **verb stem**, which identifies the forms as deriving from that particular verb: for example, in any form of the verb `talta` (e.g. `atalantiemma`, `taltuvante`, `talanter`), the verb stem `talat-` identifies the form as belonging to that particular verb (and thus expressing in some way the meaning *fall*).

Many Quenya verb stems occur in different variants due to ablaut vowel gradation (@@): for example, the verb stem of the verb `ortä` *rise* occurs as either `or-` (zero grade), `oro-` (short grade) or `ór-` (lengthened grade). Different tense-aspect stems of such verbs differ in the vowel-grade they show.

For verbs which have variant verb stems, all variants are given below, where required.

Through the addition of various suffixes, prefixes and ablaut, a **tense-aspect stem** is formed. The tense-aspect stem identifies the form as having a particular combination of tense-aspect.

Five different kinds of tense-aspect stems maybe distinguished; these fall into the three overarching systems described above (@@):

+ aorist tense-aspect: aorist stems, past stems, future stems;
+ present tense-aspect: present stems, imperfect stems;
+ perfect tense-aspect: perfect stems.

The mechanisms involved in forming tense-aspect stems from verb stems are detailed in the individual chapters on the present (@@), aorist (@@), future (@@), and perfect (@@) stems.

!!! attention "To-Do"
	Verbs lacking certain tense-aspect stems altogether are called **defective verbs**. Are there examples of defective verbs in Quenya?
	
#### Thematic Vowels

Some elements appear between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect stem derivative suffixes:

+ Many Quenya verb forms include a thematic vowel (or: 'theme vowel') `a` standing between the stem and the suffix, e.g. <code>ort<b>a</b>uva</code>, <code>hent<b>a</b>nie</code>; for details, @@ below.

#### Endings

Some verb forms also have an ending, which supplies additional information to the form.

+ For finite verbs, the ending ('personal ending') also expresses person, number and sometimes (in the imperative) mood;
+ The endings of participles and verbal adjectives express case and number.

The endings are treated more fully below, @@.

#### Augments and Prepositional Prefixes

Finally, some elements precede the stem:

+ perfect stems might include an augment, which takes the form of a **root vowel**[^1] directly preceding the stem (e.g. `e-cénie`), or, if the verb stem begins with a vowel, either that vowel is lengthened (e.g. `úlie`) or the syllable is duplicated (`orórie`). For details, @@.
+ Many compound verbs begin with a prepositional prefix, an original preposition integrated into the verb form, e.g. `ettule`, `aucirë` (@@). These prefixes are always the first element of a form, preceding even augments and reduplications (@@).

A final consonant of such prefixes often assimilates to the following sound: e.g. `eccezë` but `etecézie` (@@).

!!! tip "Assumption"
	If the prefix ends in a vowel, this vowel usually drops out before another vowel (elision, @@).

!!! note
	For reduplications, @@.

[^1]: also known as `ómataima`.

## Thematic and Athematic Conjugations

Quenya verb forms are either thematic or athematic. Thematic forms include a thematic vowel `a` between the verb-stem and the non-finite or tense-aspect suffix. Athematic forms do not include a thematic vowel: thus in athematic forms tense-aspect suffix is attached immediately to the stem:

+ **Thematic conjugations**: all forms of causative verbs, aorist-stem forms of all secondary verbs, past-stem forms of progressive verbs, present-, past and perfect-stem forms of derivative verbs, gerund of progressive and invertable verbs;
+ **Athematic conjugations**: all forms of basic verbs, future-stem forms of progressive, formative and derivative verbs, present-, perfect-stem forms of progressive and formative verbs, present-stem forms of progressive verbs, past-stem forms of formative verbs.

Some examples with the verb `fara` *hunt*:

+ `faran`: 1 sg. aor. thematic: thematic vowel `a` stands between the ending `-n` and the aorist-stem;
+ `fáran`: 1 sg. pres. athematic: the tense-aspect suffix `a` is a part of the present-stem;
+ `faranen`: 1 sg. pret. thematic: thematic vowel `a` stands between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect suffix `-ne`;
+ `faruvan`: 1 sg. fut. athematic: the tense-aspect suffix `-uva` is attached to the verb-stem directly;
+ `faráve`: ger. thematic: thematic vowel `a` is inserted before the gerundial suffix;
+ `farite`: inf. athematic: the infinitive suffix `-ita` is attached directly to the verb-stem.

!!! tip "Assumption"
	No infinitive form but of basic verbs is attested. 

Some non-finite verbal forms (verbal adjectives in `-ite`) include a different thematic vowel &mdash; the **root vowel** which follows the verbal stems: `caraitë` *busy*, `coloite` *tolerant*. Same thematic vowel was added in deverbal nouns (for these, @@).

## Endings

### Personal and Apersonal Endings

The (a)personal endings of finite verb forms are either long or short, and are the same for all stems:

+ Apersonal endings mark number, and they are used when the subject of the verb is explicit;
+ Personal endings mark number and person when the subject is left implicit.
