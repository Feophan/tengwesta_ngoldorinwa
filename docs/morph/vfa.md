# The Aorist Stem

### Ablaut in Aorist Stems

Aorist stem is formed from a verb stem with either a short- or zero-grade ablaut:

+ **zero-grade**: formative and long verbs in aorist and future;
+ **short-grade**: basic verbs, a-verbs, u-verbs, causative verbs, derivative verbs in all tenses, formative and long verbs in preterite.

### Thematic and Athematic Aorists

Forms built on the aorist stem follow either a thematic or an athematic conjugation.

+ **thematic** conjugation: all causative tense forms, aorist and preterite tense forms of derivative and a-verbs, aorist tense form of long and formative verbs.
+ **athematic** conjugation: all basic and u-verbs tense forms, preterite and future tense forms of long and formative verbs, future tense forms of derivative and a-verbs.

### Tense Endings

Tense endings are added after a theme vowel in thematic conjugations, or directly to stem in athematic conjugations.

+ aorist tense endings: `-ë` in basic, *nil* everywhere else.
+ preterite tense ending: `-(n)e`.
+ future tense ending: `-uva`.

!!! warning "Exception"
	The u-verbs might receive the aorist tense-ending when unmarked for number or person, but drop it before secondary ending: `haru-` > `haru(ë)` > `harun`.
	
### Sound Changes in Tense Stems

Several sound changes become apparent in aorist stems. The most important is **metathesis** (@@), discussed below. For **rhotacism** and other, more obscure changes, @@.

Metathesis occurs in preterite tense of athematic conjugation, except for u-verbs, and might involve **assimilation** (@@): `cat-` > `cat-ne` > `cante`, `tup-` > `tup-ne` > `tumpe`, `sulup-` > `sulup-ne` > `sulumpe`.

Verbs which experience metathesis:

+ ending in **voiceless stops** `-p`, `-t`, `-c`: `cap-ne > campe`, `mat-ne > mante`, `ruc-ne > runce`;
+ ending in **voiced stop** `-d`: `red-ne > rende`;
+ ending in **fricatives** `-f`, `-h`, `-z`: `raf-ne > rappe`, `lah-ne > lacce`, `cez-ne > cenze`;
+ ending in `-l`: `tul-ne > tulle`;
+ ending in `-s`: `hlas-ne > hlasse`.

!!! note
	Ending in `-l` commonly had an alternative form without metathesis: `tul-ne > tulde`.
	
!!! important "Late Tarquesta"
	The combination `-mne` was pronounced /nne/, but it was not reflected in spelling: `nemne` /nenne/.

### Overview of Regular Forms

Examples (zero-grade ablaut stems and thematic vowels are highlighted):

|	vocalic u (a)	|	liru-	|	liru-(ë)	|	liru-ne	|	liru-uva	|
|	vocalic u (b)	|	nicu-	|	niqu-ë	|	niqu-ne	|	nicu-uva	|

## Particular Formations

### Spurious u-Verbs

The u-verbs which end in a velar consonant behave transiently between true u-verbs and basic verbs. They receive ending like basic verbs in aorist and preterite: `micu-` > aorist `miquë`, preterite `minque`; but behave like true u-verbs in future: `micu-uva` > `micúva`.

### Augmented Preterite

A special group of formative verbs of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tā</span> shape might form preterite from inverted root with an augment: `is-t > i-si-t-ne > isinte`, `or-y > o-ro-t-ne > oronte`. The resulting form is superficially the same as from short-grade ablaut: `isi-t-ne > isinte`, `orot-ne > oronte`. However, the augment is not a part of the stem, and can be freely omitted, especially if following a vowel (elision, @@): `sinte`, `ronte`. The vowel of a short-grade ablaut stem can't be elided.  

### Long Preterite

Some basic and formative verbs show a lengthened-grade ablaut in preterite:

+ verbs ending in `-b` or `-w`: `lab-` > `láve`, `tyaw-` > `tyáve`;

!!! important "Late Tarquesta"
	+ verbs ending in `-d` beside regular `-nde` sometimes reformed either to no-metathesis `-rne`: `nid-` > `nirne`; or long preterite: `yod-` > `yóre`;
	+ later verbs in `-l` also formed a long preterite: `tul-` > `túle`;
