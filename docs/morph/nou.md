## First-Declension Nouns ## {: #fdn }

### Stems and Types of First-Declension Nouns

The first declension is also known as the **vocalic declension**, since it consists of nouns with a stem historically ending in an ā- and ō-sounds.

The following types of noun belong to the first declension:

+ **strong**: *disyllabic* nouns or nouns with a *heavy penult*;
+ **weak**: nouns with a *light penult*;
+ nouns in `-oa`.

### Nouns in -a ### {: #fdna }

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| cirya    	| *ship*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| cirya    	| ciryar    	|
| `gen. I` 	| ciryo    	| ciryaron  	|
| `gen. II`	| ciryava  	| ciryaiva  	|
| `dat.`   	| ciryan   	| ciryain   	|
| `instr.` 	| ciryanen 	| ciryainen 	|
| `loc.`   	| ciryasse 	| ciryassen 	|
| `abl.`   	| ciryallo 	| ciryallon[^d11]	|
| `all.`   	| ciryanna 	| ciryannar 	|
| **weak**  |**telluma**| ***dome***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| telluma   | tellumar    	|
| `gen. I` 	| telluma   | tellumáron  	|
| `gen. II`	| tellumáva | tellumaiva  	|
| `dat.`   	| telluman  | tellumain   	|
| `instr.` 	| tellumánen| tellumainen 	|
| `loc.`   	| tellumasse| tellumassen 	|
| `abl.`   	| tellumallo| tellumallon 	|
| `all.`   	| tellumanna| tellumannar 	|

A few nouns of the first declension, like `erma` *matter*, have historically ended in a short ă-sound. Those belong to the **strong** declension.

!!! note 
	Nouns having in the last syllable `-ra` use *i-plural* instead of *r-plural*: `aura` *posession* &mdash; `aure` *possessions*.[^d12]

### Nouns in -o

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| ondo    	| *stone*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| ondo    	| ondor    		|
| `gen. I` 	| ondo    	| ondoron	  	|
| `gen. II`	| ondova  	| ondoiva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| ondon   	| ondoin   		|
| `instr.` 	| ondonen 	| ondoinen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| ondosse 	| ondossen	 	|
| `abl.`   	| ondollo 	| ondollon	 	|
| `all.`   	| ondonna 	| ondonnar	 	|
| **weak**  | **ontamo**| ***mason***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| ontamo   	| ontamor    	|
| `gen. I` 	| ontamo   	| ontamóron  	|
| `gen. II`	| ontamóva 	| ontamoiva  	|
| `dat.`   	| ontamon  	| ontamoin   	|
| `instr.` 	| ontamónen	| ontamoinen 	|
| `loc.`   	| ontamosse	| ontamossen 	|
| `abl.`   	| ontamollo	| ontamollon 	|
| `all.`   	| ontamonna	| ontamonnar 	|

Many male names and agental nouns with suffixes `-mo`, `-ro` belong to the **weak** declension[^d13]: `Ulmo` &mdash; `Ulmóva`.

!!! note 
	Nouns having in the last syllable `-ro` (especially unstable agental suffix) use *i-plural* instead of *r-plural*: `nostaro` *parent* &mdash; `nostari` *parents*.[^d12]

### Nouns in -oa

Overview of forms:

| 		  	| coa    	| *house*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| coa    	| coar    		|
| `gen. I` 	| cuo[^d14]  	| coaron	  	|
| `gen. II`	| coava  	| coaiva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| coan   	| coain   		|
| `instr.` 	| coanen 	| coainen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| coasse 	| coassen	 	|
| `abl.`   	| coallo 	| coallon	 	|
| `all.`   	| coanna 	| coannar	 	|

[^d11]: With alternative euphonic variant `-llor`. This is applicable to ablative plural in general.
[^d12]: To avoid unpreferrable `rVr` sequence. Plural on `-e` is not controversial, appearing in [DN4], [DN5b], [DN5c], and generally agreeing with a behaviour of the final `-ai` in OP1 and plural adjectives. The situation with `-oi` is more obscure: [DN5] suggested `-oi > -o`, while [OP1] &mdash; `-oi# > -ui#` [PE19/66]. However, [PE19/63] indicates that `-ui# > -ue, -uvi`. Alternative of `-oi# > -i#` from [PE19/66] is also possible, thus making unstable `-r(o)` regular. The last choice is used here. 
[^d13]: Such explanation for `Ulmóva` is given in [PE21/8].
[^d14]: Supposedly, `kawā-ō > kawō > köo > kuo`. Alternative form `có` from `kawā-ō > koa-ō > köo > kō` has been proposed before, and both could coexist [PE21/40].

## Second-Declension Nouns ## {: #sdn }

### Stems and Types of Second-Declension Nouns

The second declension is also known as the **e-declension**, since it consists of nouns with a stem historically ending in an ē-sound. It is perhaps the most common declension.

The following types of noun belong to the second declension:

+ **strong** nouns in `-e`: *disyllabic* or with a *heavy penult*;
+ **strong** nouns in `-ye`: *disyllabic* or with a *heavy penult*;
+ their **weak** variants with a *light penult*.

### Nouns in -e ### {: #nie }

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| lasse    	| *leaf*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| lasse    	| lassi	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| lasseo   	| lassion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| lasseva  	| lassíva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| lassen   	| lassin	   	|
| `instr.` 	| lassenen 	| lassínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| lassesse 	| lassissen[^d21]	|
| `abl.`   	| lassello 	| lassillon		|
| `all.`   	| lassenna 	| lassinnar 	|
| **weak**  |**undume**	| ***abyss***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| undume   	| undumi    	|
| `gen. I` 	| undumèo[^d22]| undumion  	|
| `gen. II`	| unduméva	 | undumíva  	|
| `dat.`   	| undumen  	 | undumin   	|
| `instr.` 	| unduménen	 | undumínen 	|
| `loc.`   	| undumesse  | undumissen 	|
| `abl.`   	| undumello	 | undumillon 	|
| `all.`   	| undumenna  | unduminnar 	|

Some nouns which have a diphthong in the root are **weak**: `huine` *gloom* &mdash; `huinéva`, etc.

In some texts forms like `nasser` *natures*, `wenderon` *of maidens*, `lasseron` *of leaves* can be found. Those are literary and largely out of use.

!!! note 
	Some nouns in `-e` irregularly decline like nouns in `-ye`, particularly those ending in `-le`, `-ve` and `-tse`: `fintaler` *tricks*, `tyáver` *tastes*, `lotser` *flowers*.

### Nouns in -ye and -ie ### {: #nye }

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| selye    	| *daughter*   	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| selye    	| selyer   		|
| `gen. I` 	| selyo[^d23]	| selyeron	  	|
| `gen. II`	| selyeva  	| selyéva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| selyen   	| selyéna[^d24]  	|
| `instr.` 	| selyenen 	| selyénen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| selyesse 	| selyessen	 	|
| `abl.`   	| selyello 	| selyellon	 	|
| `all.`   	| selyenna 	| selyennar	 	|
| **weak**  | **tyalie**| ***mirth***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| tyalie   	| tyalier    	|
| `gen. I` 	| tyalio[^d25]| tyaliéron  	|
| `gen. II`	| tyaliéva 	| tyaliéva[^d26]	|
| `dat.`   	| tyalien  	| tyaliéna   	|
| `instr.` 	| tyaliénen	| tyaliénen[^d26]	|
| `loc.`   	| tyaliesse	| tyaliessen 	|
| `abl.`   	| tyaliello	| tyaliellon 	|
| `all.`   	| tyalienna	| tyaliennar 	|

Disyllabic nouns in `-ie` are **strong**: `tie` *path* &mdash; `tieva`, etc.

!!! note 
	Abstract nouns can have epenthetic `-n-` in **common**, **genitive-partitive** and **dative**: `márie` *happiness* &mdash; `máriéno`, `máriéna`.

[^d21]: Classically, `lassessen`, etc, as per PD. The change is first suggested in [DN5b], but supported by such later examples as `lúmissen` *at times*.
[^d22]: Alternatively, `undumo`. The position of the stress is debatable, but here I follow [PE21/41] and mark atypical stress with a grave accent. On `undumo`, cf [3].
[^d23]: Considering AQ plural `lassio` (from a regular change `ei-o > io`), I assume in agreement with [PE21/7] a singular form `lasso`. It is expected that genitive-partitive `-o` was originally replacing final vowels of the first and second declensions (thus we don't see `-uo` in nouns on `-o`), similar to dual `-u`. From this perspective I find early forms of DN4 and DN5 on `-yo` and `-io` fitting LQ paradigm. 
[^d24]: In DN6 we find plural dative on `-ino`. This form seems to be its suitable update, taking long dative into account.
[^d25]: `tyalièo` is attested in [PE17/72]. However, whether it was a fixed idea is debatable (particularly in having three vowels in hiatus, cf. the Note below), as well as what is its stress patern, is unclear.
[^d26]: Despite these plural forms being distinct in DN4 and DN5, `iei > iai` change seems to be solidly discarded, and syncretism is unavoidable.

## Third-Declension Nouns

### Stems and Types of Third-Declension Nouns

The third declension is also known as the **semivocalic declension**, since it consists of nouns with a stem historically ending in short ĭ- and ŭ-sounds, syllabic or non-syllabic.

The following types of noun belong to the third declension:

+ nouns in `-ë`, which show `-i-` in inflection;
+ nouns in `-ö`, which show `-u-` in inflection;
+ their **weak** variants.

### Nouns in -ë

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| súrë    	| *wind*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| súrë    	| súri	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| suryo   	| súrion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| súriva  	| súríva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| suryen[^d31]| súrin		   	|
| `instr.` 	| súrinen 	| súrínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| súrisse 	| súrissen		|
| `abl.`   	| súrillo 	| súrillon		|
| `all.`   	| súrinna 	| súrinnar	 	|
| **weak**  |**lindë**	| ***song***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| lindë   	| lindi    		|
| `gen. I` 	| lindio	| lindion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| lindiva	| lindíva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| lindin	| lindína   	|
| `instr.` 	| lindinen	| lindínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| lindisse  | lindissen 	|
| `abl.`   	| lindillo	| lindillon 	|
| `all.`   	| lindinna  | lindinnar 	|

### Nouns in -ö

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| ruscö    	| *fox*   		|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| ruscö    	| rusqui   		|
| `gen. I` 	| rusquo	| rusquion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| ruscuva  	| rusquiva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| rusquen[^d31]| rusquin	 	|
| `instr.` 	| ruscunen 	| rusquínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| ruscusse 	| ruscussen	 	|
| `abl.`   	| ruscullo 	| ruscullon	 	|
| `all.`   	| ruscunna 	| ruscunnar	 	|
| **weak**  | **luppö** | ***lump***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| luppö   	| luppuvi    	|
| `gen. I` 	| luppuo	| luppuron  	|
| `gen. II`	| luppuva 	| luppuiva		|
| `dat.`   	| luppun  	| luppuin   	|
| `instr.` 	| luppunen	| luppuinen		|
| `loc.`   	| luppusse	| luppussen 	|
| `abl.`   	| luppullo	| luppullon 	|
| `all.`   	| lupunna	| luppunnar 	|

!!! note 
	Weak nouns might have plural forms of the **first** declension: `macsö` *mire* &mdash; `macsor`.

!!! warning 
	Words of this declension originally tend to be reanalyzed as belonging to the **first** and **second** declension respectively[^d32]: `taurisse` \> `tauresse`, `languen` \> `langon`. Use them consistently!

[^d31]: Alternatively, `súrin`, `ruscun`, etc. Perhaps one of the most contentious positions of all the charts. On more detailed reasoning for this choice, see [TBD].
[^d32]: First discussed in DN4, this is strongly supported by Tolkien's, most probably unintentional, change of historical forms: compare [PE21/76] and [PE17/92] for one instance. Instead of discarding semivocalic forms, here such instances are treated as later analogies and reinterpretations.  

## Fourth-Declension Nouns

### Stems and Types of Fourth-Declension Nouns

The fourth declension is also known as the **animate** declension.

The following types of noun belong to the fourth declension:

+ **masculine** nouns in `-u`;
+ **feminine** nouns in `-i`.

Overview of forms:

| masculine	| ainu    	| *angel*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| ainu    	| ainur	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| ainuo   	| ainúron	  	|
| `gen. II`	| ainúva  	| ainuiva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| ainun		| ainuin	   	|
| `instr.` 	| ainúnen 	| ainuinen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| ainusse 	| ainussen		|
| `abl.`   	| ainullo 	| ainullon		|
| `all.`   	| ainunna 	| ainunnar	 	|
| **feminine**|**tári** | ***queen***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| tári   	| tári    		|
| `gen. I` 	| tário		| tárion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| táríva	| táríva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| tárin		| tárin[^d41]		|
| `instr.` 	| tárínen	| tárínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| tárisse   | tárissen 		|
| `abl.`   	| tárillo	| tárillon 		|
| `all.`   	| tárinna   | tárinnar 		|

!!! note 
	Nouns in `-ru` have *i-plural*: `veru` *husband* --- `veruvi`, `veruion`.

!!! note 
	Some nouns in `-i` permit *r-plural*: `quendi` *woman* --- `quendir`, `quendíron`.

[^d41]: Alternatively, `tárína`, but the same form can be used in singular. A disambiguation with plural epenthetic `-n` (`tárínan`) seems possible [cf TBD].  

## Fifth-Declension Nouns

### Stems and Types of Fifth-Declension Nouns

All fifth-declension nouns have a **stem ending in a consonant**.

Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different **subtypes** of the fifth declension are distinguished. The differences between these types largely depend on two factors:

+ (type of) the consonant in which the stem ends;
+ length of the vowel in the stem.

It is often impossible to derive the stem of a fifth-declension noun (and thus the exact pattern of that noun’s declension) from the *common singular* alone: the genitive is required to determine which subtype the noun belongs to. Compare, for example:

| n-base	| aran    	| *king*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| aran    	| arani	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| arano   	| aranion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| aranwa  	| araníva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| aranen	| aranin	   	|
| `instr.` 	| aranwen 	| aranínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| aranesse 	| aranissen		|
| `abl.`   	| aranello 	| aranillon		|
| `all.`   	| aranna 	| arannar	 	|
| **nd-base**|**wilwarin**  | ***butterfly***  	|
|         	| *sg*     		| *pl*      		|
| `com.`   	| wilwarin   	| wilwarindi    	|
| `gen. I` 	| wilwarindo	| wilwarindion		|
| `gen. II`	| wilwarinduva	| wilwarindíva		|
| `dat.`   	| wilwarinden	| wilwarindin		|
| `instr.` 	| wilwarindanen	| wilwarindínen		|
| `loc.`   	| wilwarindesse | wilwarindissen	|
| `abl.`   	| wilwarindello	| wilwarindillon	|
| `all.`   	| wilwarindenna | wilwarindinnar	|
| **nt-base**|**oron**  | ***mountain***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      		|
| `com.`   	| oron   	| oronti    		|
| `gen. I` 	| oronto	| orontion			|
| `gen. II`	| orontuva	| orontíva			|
| `dat.`   	| oronten	| orontin			|
| `instr.` 	| orontanen	| orontínen			|
| `loc.`   	| orontesse | orontissen		|
| `abl.`   	| orontello	| orontillon		|
| `all.`   	| orontenna | orontinnar		|

#### Overview of Bases

1. if *common singular* ends in `-n`, the base might be `-nd-`, `-nt-`, `-ng-`, `-m-`, `-mb-`;
2. if *common singular* ends in `-s`, the base might be `-ss-`, `-st-`, `-cs-`, `-ts-`, `-ps-`;
3. if *common singular* ends in `-t`, the base might be `-c-`, `-p-`, `-ct-`;
4. if *common singular* ends in `-r`, the base might be `-rd`, `-rt`;
5. if *common singular* ends in `-l`, the base might be `-ld`.

!!! note 
	In Late Quenya[^d53] final `-t` became `-s`, and subtypes (2) and (3) merged into one large group.
	
#### Assimilated and Other Special Forms

Nouns with simple bases have some distinct endings in the singular:

+ bases on `-m` have **genitive-adjective** in `-nwa`, **instrumental** in `-mnen`;
+ bases on `-n` have **genitive-adjective** in `-nwa`, **instrumental** in -`nwen`, **allative** in `-nna`;
+ bases on `-l` have **genitive-adjective** in `-lwa`, **instrumental** in `-lmen`, **ablative** in `-llo`;
+ bases on `-r` have **genitive-adjective** in `-rwa`, **instrumental** in `-rmen`;
+ bases on `-s` have **genitive-adjective** in `-rwa`, **instrumental** in `-rmen`, **locative** in `-sse`;
+ bases on `-t` have **instrumental** in `-twen`.

In addition to those, for some old nouns it is possible to encounter similar forms in other cases, which are, however, rarely used in later speech:

+ in **ablative**:
	+ bases on `-n`, `-r` and `-s` can have `-llo`;
	+ bases on `-m` can have `-lmo`;
+ in **locative**:
	+ bases on `-l`, `-n` and `-r` can have `-lde`, `-nde` and `-rde`;
	+ bases on `-l` and `-t` can have `-lse` and `-tse`;
+ in **allative**:
	+ bases on `-l` can have `-lda`.
	
### Monosyllabic Nouns

Monosyllabic nouns belonging to fifth declension can be divided into groups:

+ **strong** nouns which keep **long** stem;
+ **weak** nouns which keep **short** stem;
+ **mixed** nouns which have **long** stem in *common*, but otherwise **short**.

Overview of forms:

| strong	| mól    	| *slave*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|

!!! warning
	Nouns that *appear* monosyllabic in *common singular* might have a base with a cluster: `nís` *woman* &mdash; `nissi`, `tol` *island* &mdash; `tolli`. They follow the polysyllabic declension.

!!! note
	Sometimes **adverbial** cases allow two forms: short assimilated (`talse` *on foot*) or long proper (`talasse` *on foot*). The former are crystalized adverbs, and the latter are typically used with a *specific* noun. The difference might be vague at times.  


[^d53]: At least post-Exile, but perhaps even limited to Gondorian usage [cf TBD]. 
[^d51]: Or `molmen`.
[^d52]: Originally `molossen`. However, it is possible that the same time `lassessen > lassissen` change happened, consonantal declension did so as well. Here done to bridge with DN4 forms. 

## Sixth-Declension Nouns

### Stems and Types of Sixth-Declension Nouns

All sixth-declension nouns are irregular vocalic nouns.

The first group includes **monosyllabic** nouns that have a **stem ending in a vowel**. These nouns decline as nouns of either first or fourth declension, but are often defective and extended to disyllabic forms.

| 			| fá[^d61]   	| *breath*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| fá    	| fár	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| fáo   	| fáron		  	|
| `gen. II`	| fáva  	| faiva		  	|
| `dat.`   	| fán		| fain		   	|
| `instr.` 	| fánen 	| fainen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| fasse 	| fassen		|
| `abl.`   	| fallo 	| fallon		|
| `all.`   	| fanna 	| fannar	 	|

The second group includes nouns that **end in a consonant** in common case, but decline as **vocalic** nouns.
