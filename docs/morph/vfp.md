# The Perfect Stem

### Ablaut in Perfect Stems

Perfect stem is formed from a verb stem with either a zero- or lengthened-grade ablaut:

+ **zero-grade**: causative and derivative verbs;
+ **lengthened-grade**: basic verbs, a-verbs, u-verbs, and formative verbs.

!!! warning "Exception"
	Long verbs make their perfect tense stem with **short-grade** ablaut, see below.
	
!!! note "Reminder"
	Derivative and causative conjugations have **only zero-grade** stem (&rarr;@@).
	
	Long conjugations have **no lengthened-grade** stem.

### Thematic and Athematic Perfects

Forms built on the perfect stem follow either a thematic or an athematic conjugation.

+ **thematic** conjugation: derivative and causative verbs.
+ **athematic** conjugation: all other verbs.

### Tense Endings

Tense endings are added after a theme vowel in thematic conjugations, or directly to stem in athematic conjugations.

+ thematic ending: `-nie`, also in long verbs; 
+ athematic ending: `-ie`. 

### Overview of Regular Forms

Examples (lengthened-grade ablaut stems and thematic vowels are highlighted):

|		|	verb stem	| perfect tense stem	|
|	---	|	---	|	---	|
|	basic	|	cen-	|	e-**cén**-ie	|
|	vocalic u	|	lir-u-	|	i-**lír**-u-ie	|
|	long	|	talat-	|	a-**talat**-nie > atalantie	|
|	formative (a)	|	sir-y-	|	i-**sír**-y-ie > isírie	|
|	formative (b)	|	is-t-	|	is-**ís**-ø-ie	|
|	vocalic a	|	far-a-	|	a-**fár**-ie	|
|	derivative	|	tengu-a-	|	e-tengu-*a*-nie	|
|	causative (a)	|	tul-ya-	|	u-tul-y-*a*-nie	|
|	causative (b)	|	tul-ta-	|	u-tul-t-*a*-nie	|

!!! important "Late Tarquesta"
	Since in lengthened-grade stems formatives (a) and (b) have essentially the same form, the alternative **short-grade** forms developped to distinguish them: `is-t-` > `isi-t-nie` > `isintie`.
	
!!! attention "To-Do"
	Perfect from the preterite forms like *engie*, *lambie*, *alahtie*.
