## Stems and Types of Fifth-Declension Nouns

All fifth-declension nouns have a **stem ending in a consonant**.

Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different **subtypes** of the fifth declension are distinguished. The differences between these types largely depend on two factors:

+ (type of) the consonant in which the stem ends;
+ length of the vowel in the stem.

It is often impossible to derive the stem of a fifth-declension noun (and thus the exact pattern of that noun’s declension) from the *common singular* alone: the genitive is required to determine which subtype the noun belongs to. Compare, for example:

| n-base	| aran    	| *king*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| aran    	| arani	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| arano   	| aranion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| aranwa  	| araníva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| aranen	| aranin	   	|
| `instr.` 	| aranwen 	| aranínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| aranesse 	| aranissen		|
| `abl.`   	| aranello 	| aranillon		|
| `all.`   	| aranna 	| arannar	 	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
| **nd-base**|**wilwarin**  | ***butterfly***  	|
|         	| *sg*     		| *pl*      		|
| `com.`   	| wilwarin   	| wilwarindi    	|
| `gen. I` 	| wilwarindo	| wilwarindion		|
| `gen. II`	| wilwarinduva	| wilwarindíva		|
| `dat.`   	| wilwarinden	| wilwarindin		|
| `instr.` 	| wilwarindanen	| wilwarindínen		|
| `loc.`   	| wilwarindesse | wilwarindissen	|
| `abl.`   	| wilwarindello	| wilwarindillon	|
| `all.`   	| wilwarindenna | wilwarindinnar	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
| **nt-base**|**oron**  | ***mountain***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      		|
| `com.`   	| oron   	| oronti    		|
| `gen. I` 	| oronto	| orontion			|
| `gen. II`	| orontuva	| orontíva			|
| `dat.`   	| oronten	| orontin			|
| `instr.` 	| orontanen	| orontínen			|
| `loc.`   	| orontesse | orontissen		|
| `abl.`   	| orontello	| orontillon		|
| `all.`   	| orontenna | orontinnar		|

### Overview of Bases

1. if *common singular* ends in `-n`, the base might be `-nd-`, `-nt-`, `-ng-`, `-m-`, `-mb-`;
2. if *common singular* ends in `-s`, the base might be `-ss-`, `-st-`, `-cs-`, `-ts-`, `-ps-`;
3. if *common singular* ends in `-t`, the base might be `-c-`, `-p-`, `-ct-`;
4. if *common singular* ends in `-r`, the base might be `-rd`, `-rt`;
5. if *common singular* ends in `-l`, the base might be `-ld`.

!!! note 
	In Late Quenya[^3] final `-t` became `-s`, and subtypes (2) and (3) merged into one large group.
	
### Assimilated and Other Special Forms

Nouns with simple bases have some distinct endings in the singular:

+ bases on `-m` have **genitive-adjective** in `-nwa`, **instrumental** in `-mnen`;
+ bases on `-n` have **genitive-adjective** in `-nwa`, **instrumental** in -`nwen`, **allative** in `-nna`;
+ bases on `-l` have **genitive-adjective** in `-lwa`, **instrumental** in `-lmen`, **ablative** in `-llo`;
+ bases on `-r` have **genitive-adjective** in `-rwa`, **instrumental** in `-rmen`;
+ bases on `-s` have **genitive-adjective** in `-rwa`, **instrumental** in `-rmen`, **locative** in `-sse`;
+ bases on `-t` have **instrumental** in `-twen`.

In addition to those, for some old nouns it is possible to encounter similar forms in other cases, which are, however, rarely used in later speech:

+ in **ablative**:
	+ bases on `-n`, `-r` and `-s` can have `-llo`;
	+ bases on `-m` can have `-lmo`;
+ in **locative**:
	+ bases on `-l`, `-n` and `-r` can have `-lde`, `-nde` and `-rde`;
	+ bases on `-l` and `-t` can have `-lse` and `-tse`;
+ in **allative**:
	+ bases on `-l` can have `-lda`.
	
## Monosyllabic Nouns

Monosyllabic nouns belonging to fifth declension can be divided into groups:

+ **strong** nouns which keep **long** stem;
+ **weak** nouns which keep **short** stem;
+ **mixed** nouns which have **long** stem in *common*, but otherwise **short**.

Overview of forms:

| strong	| mól    	| *slave*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| mól    	| móli	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| mólo   	| mólion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| móluva	| mólíva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| mólen		| mólin	  	 	|
| `instr.` 	| mólanen[^1]| mólínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| mólosse 	| mólissen[^2]	|
| `abl.`   	| mólollo 	| mólillon		|
| `all.`   	| mólonna 	| mólinnar	 	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
| **weak**	| **cas**   | ***head***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| cas   	| cari    		|
| `gen. I` 	| caro		| carion		|
| `gen. II`	| carwa		| caríva		|
| `dat.`   	| caren		| carin			|
| `instr.` 	| carmen	| carínen		|
| `loc.`   	| carasse 	| carissen		|
| `abl.`   	| carallo	| carillon		|
| `all.`   	| caranna 	| carinnar		|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
| **mixed** |**tál**    | ***foot***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| tál   	| tali    		|
| `gen. I` 	| talo		| talion		|
| `gen. II`	| talwa		| talíva		|
| `dat.`   	| talen		| talin			|
| `instr.` 	| talmen	| talínen		|
| `loc.`   	| talasse 	| talissen		|
| `abl.`   	| talallo	| talillon		|
| `all.`   	| talanna 	| talinnar		|

!!! warning
	Nouns that *appear* monosyllabic in *common singular* might have a base with a cluster: `nís` *woman* &mdash; `nissi`, `tol` *island* &mdash; `tolli`. They follow the polysyllabic declension.

!!! note
	Sometimes **adverbial** cases allow two forms: short assimilated (`talse` *on foot*) or long proper (`talasse` *on foot*). The former are crystalized adverbs, and the latter are typically used with a *specific* noun. The difference might be vague at times.  


[^3]: At least post-Exile, but perhaps even limited to Gondorian usage [cf TBD]. 
[^1]: Or `molmen`.
[^2]: Originally `molossen`. However, it is possible that the same time `lassessen > lassissen` change happened, consonantal declension did so as well. Here done to bridge with DN4 forms.
