## Stems and Types of Second-Declension Nouns

The second declension is also known as the **e-declension**, since it consists of nouns with a stem historically ending in an ē-sound. It is perhaps the most common declension.

The following types of noun belong to the second declension:

+ **strong** nouns in `-e`: *disyllabic* or with a *heavy penult*;
+ **strong** nouns in `-ye`: *disyllabic* or with a *heavy penult*;
+ their **weak** variants with a *light penult*.

## Nouns in -e

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| lasse    	| *leaf*    	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| lasse    	| lassi	    	|
| `gen. I` 	| lasseo   	| lassion	  	|
| `gen. II`	| lasseva  	| lassíva	  	|
| `dat.`   	| lassen   	| lassin	   	|
| `instr.` 	| lassenen 	| lassínen	 	|
| `loc.`   	| lassesse 	| lassissen[^1]	|
| `abl.`   	| lassello 	| lassillon		|
| `all.`   	| lassenna 	| lassinnar 	|
|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
| **weak**  |**undume**	| ***abyss***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| undume   	| undumi    	|
| `gen. I` 	| undumèo[^2]| undumion  	|
| `gen. II`	| unduméva	 | undumíva  	|
| `dat.`   	| undumen  	 | undumin   	|
| `instr.` 	| unduménen	 | undumínen 	|
| `loc.`   	| undumesse  | undumissen 	|
| `abl.`   	| undumello	 | undumillon 	|
| `all.`   	| undumenna  | unduminnar 	|

Some nouns which have a diphthong in the root are **weak**: `huine` *gloom* &mdash; `huinéva`, etc.

In some texts forms like `nasser` *natures*, `wenderon` *of maidens*, `lasseron` *of leaves* can be found. Those are literary and largely out of use.

!!! note 
	Some nouns in `-e` irregularly decline like nouns in `-ye`, particularly those ending in `-le`, `-ve` and `-tse`: `fintaler` *tricks*, `tyáver` *tastes*, `lotser` *flowers*.

## Nouns in -ye and -ie

Overview of forms:

| strong  	| selye    	| *daughter*   	|

| `com.`   	| selye    	| selyer   		|
| `gen. I` 	| selyo[^3]	| selyeron	  	|

|---------	|----------	|-----------	|
| **weak**  | **tyalie**| ***mirth***  	|
|         	| *sg*     	| *pl*      	|
| `com.`   	| tyalie   	| tyalier    	|
| `gen. I` 	| tyalio[^5]| tyaliéron  	|
| `gen. II`	| tyaliéva 	| tyaliéva[^6]	|
| `dat.`   	| tyalien  	| tyaliéna   	|
| `instr.` 	| tyaliénen	| tyaliénen[^6]	|
| `loc.`   	| tyaliesse	| tyaliessen 	|
| `abl.`   	| tyaliello	| tyaliellon 	|
| `all.`   	| tyalienna	| tyaliennar 	|

Disyllabic nouns in `-ie` are **strong**: `tie` *path* &mdash; `tieva`, etc.

!!! note 
	Abstract nouns can have epenthetic `-n-` in **common**, **genitive-partitive** and **dative**: `márie` *happiness* &mdash; `máriéno`, `máriéna`.

[^1]: Classically, `lassessen`, etc, as per PD. The change is first suggested in [DN5b], but supported by such later examples as `lúmissen` *at times*.
[^2]: Alternatively, `undumo`. The position of the stress is debatable, but here I follow [PE21/41] and mark atypical stress with a grave accent. On `undumo`, cf [3].
[^3]: Considering AQ plural `lassio` (from a regular change `ei-o > io`), I assume in agreement with [PE21/7] a singular form `lasso`. It is expected that genitive-partitive `-o` was originally replacing final vowels of the first and second declensions (thus we don't see `-uo` in nouns on `-o`), similar to dual `-u`. From this perspective I find early forms of DN4 and DN5 on `-yo` and `-io` fitting LQ paradigm. 
[^4]: In DN6 we find plural dative on `-ino`. This form seems to be its suitable update, taking long dative into account.
[^5]: `tyalièo` is attested in [PE17/72]. However, whether it was a fixed idea is debatable (particularly in having three vowels in hiatus, cf. the Note below), as well as what is its stress patern, is unclear.
[^6]: Despite these plural forms being distinct in DN4 and DN5, `iei > iai` change seems to be solidly discarded, and syncretism is unavoidable.
