# The Present Stem

### Ablaut in Present Stems

Present stem is formed from a verb stem with either a short- or lengthened-grade ablaut:

+ **short-grade**: long, causative, and derivative verbs;
+ **lengthened-grade**: basic verbs, a-verbs, u-verbs, and formative verbs with `-y`.

!!! warning "Exception"
	Formative verbs with `-t` make their present tense stem with **zero-grade** ablaut, see below.

### Thematic and Athematic Presents

Forms built on the present stem follow either a thematic or an athematic conjugation.

+ **thematic** conjugation: derivative and causative verbs.
+ **athematic** conjugation: all other verbs.

!!! important "Late Tarquesta"
	Thematic conjugation eventually spread into the rest of secondary verbs, except u-verbs: `fára` > `fárea`, `talata` > `taltea`, `síria` > `sírea`, `istya` > `istea`.

### Tense Endings

Tense endings are added after a theme vowel in thematic conjugations, or directly to stem in athematic conjugations.

+ present tense endings: `-ya` in derivative, causative verbs, and formative verbs with `-t`; `-a` in other verbs; 
+ imperfect tense ending: `-yane` in derivative and causative verbs; `-ane` in other verbs;

## Particular Formations

### Verbs Defective in Present

Verbs ending in `-e(ng)a` are **defective** and use their aorist tense form for present: `te(ng)a-` > `tea` *shows, is showing*.
