Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different subtypes of the fifth declension are distinguished.

Note In poetry the distinction is not strict, and head-modifier order can be attributive: i\u00b7fairi n\u00e9ce ringa s\u00famaryasse [MC/221]. The pale phantoms in her cold bosom . Tip The general difference between attributive and predicative position may be described in the following way: a modifier in attributive position typically serve to identify the referent of the head noun (cf. e.g. En. the good man , as opposed to any other man); a modifier in predicative position is not used to identify the referent. Rather, adjectives and participles in predicative position say something about the condition the referent is in (cf. En. I drink my coffee black , They found the premises deserted ). The predicative position is always used for predicative complements with linking verbs [REF]. However, there are various kinds of modifiers for which the distinction between the positions outlined above does not hold. These are treated below. Attributive Genitives I and II Most attributive genitives [REF] can occur in both positions: valaron arcanwar , arcanwar valaron the trones of the Valar . The difference between the two constructions appears to be that in attributive position, the genitive I is presented as (more) vital for the identification of the head noun (for example, when the Valar are contrasted with another people, the attributive position will be used). But often the distinction is slight. In attributive position whether the head is definite of indefinite is undetermined, and the article modifies only the genitive: i\u00b7t\u00farin i\u00b7cormaron , i\u00b7cormaron t\u00farin the Lord of the Rings The rules of attributive genitive I above apply to attributive genitive II as well. However, it also can be treated as a quasi-adjective (for details, [REF]), not modified by the article, which then stands for the whole noun phrase: i\u00b7tyulma ciryava [PE21/80].

Tip The general difference between attributive and predicative position may be described in the following way: a modifier in attributive position typically serve to identify the referent of the head noun (cf. e.g. En. the good man , as opposed to any other man); a modifier in predicative position is not used to identify the referent. Rather, adjectives and participles in predicative position say something about the condition the referent is in (cf. En. I drink my coffee black , They found the premises deserted ). The predicative position is always used for predicative complements with linking verbs [REF].

But often the distinction is slight. In attributive position whether the head is definite of indefinite is undetermined, and the article modifies only the genitive: i\u00b7t\u00farin i\u00b7cormaron , i\u00b7cormaron t\u00farin the Lord of the Rings The rules of attributive genitive I above apply to attributive genitive II as well.

The thrones endure . ulo subject \u00fava predicate [PE22/167]. The rain is coming . Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the direct object , which is also marked by the common case (\u219230.8); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called complements ): Varda subject m\u00e1ryat object ortane predicate [LotR/377].

Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object, which is marked by the dative case (\u219230.27); other verbs take a second complement in the common case: Varda subject enquantuva predicate i\u00b7yulma object nin indirect object [VT49/7]. Varda will fill the cup for me ; l\u00e1 navin predicate caritalya\u00b7s object m\u00e1ra complement [PE22/154]. I don't advise you to do so . In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, \u219226.16-23). Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are: prepositional phrases (consisting of a preposition and its complement): i subject or ilye mahalmar complement ea predicate [UT/305]. Who is above all thrones . adverbs : lende predicate tanna complement Nieliccilis subject [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le . subordinate clauses : savin predicate i Elessarno quetie naite object [PE22/158]. I believe that the words of Aragorn are true . The declarative subordinate clause (\u219241) fulfills the role of object with the predicate savin : compare Elessar in savin Elessar 'I believe Aragorn' . infinitive constructions : man subject cenuva predicate f\u00e1na cirya c\u00edra object [MC/221]. Who shall see a white ship leave . The common-and-infinitive construction (\u219251.21) fulfills the role of object with the predicate cenuva : compare and\u00fane in man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? 'Who shall see the last evening?' participle constructions : lie subject tatallaner predicate i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina object [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The common-and-participle construction (\u219252.13) fulfills the role of object with the predicate tatallaner : compare i\u00b7m\u00e1r in tatallanen i\u00b7m\u00e1r 'I marveled at the house' . When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a complex sentence . For complex sentences, \u219239. Note The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus fire die has a valency of one, anta give has a valency of three. Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb cire , when it takes only a subject, means sail , but may also take an object and then means cut . The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence. It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as tanna above , and with verbs which may have different valencies. In reality, syntactic 'obligatoriness' is better seen as a scale, with constituents being more or less obligatory depending on the verb and construction used. There are a few verbs which do not have a subject ('impersonal' verbs, \u219236), and very few of these take no other obligatory constituents (i.e. have a valency of zero). The sentence core then consists of nothing but the verb: e.g. \u00fala it is raining . 'Omission' of the Subject and Other Constituents That a verb takes a certain number of obligatory constituents does not mean that all those constituents are necessarily expressed every single time that verb is used. A constituent may be omitted if it is sufficiently clear from the context who or what is meant: roccor i\u00b7Erulingaron m\u00e1re n\u00e1r? N\u00e1r [PE22/166]. The horses of Rohirrim are good, are they not? They are . The second sentence has no explicit subject \u2014 'horses' has been the subject of the previous sentence and need not be mentioned explicitly again. Note that these constituents have to be supplied in translation ('they'). savin Elessar ar i n\u00e1ne aran Ond\u00f3reo [PE22/158]. I believe Aragorn, and that he was a King of Gondor . Elessar doesn\u2019t need to be mentioned explicitly again. \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende [PE22/166]. Close the door . English, too, normally omits the subject with imperatives. h\u00b7ore nin carita\u00b7s n\u00f3 namin alasaila [VT41/13]. I would like to do so but judge it unwise . Note how the second sentence has no explicit object, added in the translation ('it'). The lack of an explicit, separately expressed subject is particularly frequent in Quenya, and constitutes a regular feature of the language. Information about the subject of a verb is then usually expressed by the personal ending of that verb: merin sa h\u00b7aryalye galasse n\u00f3 vanyalye Ambarello [MS/1]. I hope that you have happiness before you pass from the world . The subjects ('I', 'you') are expressed by the first- and second-person singular endings. melinye\u00b7s apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love him but not him (the other) . The subjects ('I') is expressed by the first-person singular ending, while the first object ('him') by singular object clitic. In the third person, the omission of the subject is regular if the subject of the previous sentence is continued, as in ( 15 ). If the subject changes, an explicitly expressed subject is normally required (VT49/14-15). In the first and second person, explicitly expressed subjects (in the form of the personal pronouns n\u00ed , ly\u00e9 , etc.) are used only for emphasis or contrast. For such 'contrastive' pronouns, \u219229.1-4. Note The omission of other elements than the subject (such as the object in ( 18 )) is much more restricted and infrequent than the lack of an explicitly expressed subject. In the third person only the object can be substituted for a short clitic form which closely follows the verb ( 20 ). Linking Verb, Predicative Complement A linking verb (or copulative / copular verb , copula ) 'links' a subject to a nominal constituent, the so-called predicative complement , which identifies the subject or assigns a property to it. The predicative complement is usually an adjective which agrees in case and number with the subject, or a noun which agrees with the subject in case (\u219227.7, 30.3). Examples of verbs that can function as linking verbs are na be , ole become , lare remain, stay , neme seem, appear to be, prove to be , etc. [ vanwa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb ] predicate Valimar subject [LotR/377]. Lost is Valimar . [ n\u00e9se linking verb n\u00f3rima rocco predicative noun phrase ] predicate [VT49/29]. He was a horse strong at running . Note Predicative nouns or adjectives are sometimes called 'predicate nouns/adjectives'. Predicative complements agreeing with a subject are also sometimes called 'subject(ive) complements'. Linking verbs also occur with an adverbial expression of place or circumstance as their complement: e.g. n\u00e1 be (somewhere), find oneself (somewhere) . But normally special verbs of position are used instead: tule get somewhere , hare stay somewhere . In many grammatical treatments, such complements are also seen as predicative complements: n\u00ed subject [ nauva linking verb tanome complement ] predicate [VT49/19]. I will be there . The verb n\u00e1 , unlike its English counterpart, doesn\u2019t occur in the meaning exist . An expression like tasse n\u00e1 'there is' can have only contrastive meaning 'but not here'. In the ' existential ' use, the verb ea with only a subject is used instead. The verb tule also has an existential use, and then means happen : vahaia n\u00f3re subject ea predicate i ga\u00b7esta Valinor [ MQ : PE22/124]. Far a way there is a land called Valinor . Some other verbs link an object to a predicative complement that agrees with that object (both are in the common). Examples of such verbs are consider X (to be) Y, make X Y, appoint X as Y (for more details, \u219230.10): alasaila n\u00e1 l\u00e1 care tai object mo subject [ nave verb m\u00e1ra predicative adjective ] predicate [PE22/154]. It is unwise not to do what one judges good . Note Predicative complements agreeing with an object are sometimes called 'object(ive) complements'. Omission of a Linking Verb: Nominal Sentences Frequently, a linking verb such as na is lacking in a sentence, whose core then contains only nominal elements. This occurs especially in the following cases: when predicative adjective follows the subject: i\u00b7roccor subject rindi predicate [ MQ : PE21/78]. The horses are swift ; Elessarno quetie subject naite predicate [PE22/158]. The words of Aragorn are true.

Only the present indicative of na be is regularly omitted as linking verb in this way: other forms such as imperfect n\u00e1ne or future nauva are not normally omitted, unless other indications of time are present, especially in expressions of location or direction of movement: masse l\u00e9 enar?
