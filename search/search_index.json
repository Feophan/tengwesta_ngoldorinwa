Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different subtypes of the fifth declension are distinguished.

Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different subtypes of the fifth declension are distinguished. The differences between these types largely depend on two factors: (type of) the consonant in which the stem ends; length of the vowel in the stem. It is often impossible to derive the stem of a fifth-declension noun (and thus the exact pattern of that noun\u2019s declension) from the common singular alone: the genitive is required to determine which subtype the noun belongs to.

The Quenya equivalent of an indefinite article is the lack of an article: nai elen siluva lyenna [VT49/40]. May a star shine upon you . luini tellumar yassen tintilar i\u00b7eleni [RGEO/58]. Blue domes in which twinkle the stars . The article is 'definite' because it refers to someone/something that is identifiable : the article expresses that it is clear who/what is meant, and that it can be distinguished from other people/things. The article is also 'pragmatic' because it modifies what is identifiable only contrary to common knowledge: when distinguished from a context alone, article is usually omitted. Warning Quenya often doesn\u2019t use the definite article where English would (see examples below). The lack of an article in prose is normally significant, but in poetry the article is omitted much more freely: i\u00b7oromardi tanna lende ar wingildi wilwarindie The wood-spirits and the foam-like butterflies came thither [PE16/96]. The prose version would include definite i\u00b7wingildi instead. Reasons for Pragmatic (Marked) Identifiability of a Referent The referent of a noun is usually identifiable when it has been mentioned before : onortanen rocco. I\u00b7rocco n\u00f3rima n\u00e9 [modified; PE17/168, VT49/29]. I rode a horse. The horse was strong at running . A referent is identifiable when it is made specific by the immediate context : \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende, mecin [PE22/166]. Close the door, please . There\u2019s only one open door in the room. auta i\u00b7l\u00f3me [MC/222]. The night is passing! The night right now . aistana i y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo Y\u00e9sus [VT43/27]. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus . i\u00b7y\u00e1ve becomes identifiable through the information added in the apposition. The article is used if the noun is conceptualized and doesn\u2019t refer to a specific referent: epetai i\u00b7jarma \u00fa ten ulca s\u00edmaryassen [VT49/8]. The left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations . i\u00b7jarma doesn\u2019t refer to a specific left hand, but to a concept of the left hand. Reasons for Semantic (Unmarked) Identifiability of a Referent A referent is identifiable when it is obvious from the immediate context of its relation to another noun (note that English uses the article in many such cases): an c\u00e9 mo querne cendele n\u00famenna [VT49/8]. For if one turned the face westward . cendele is defined uniquely as belonging to a subject of the sentence. However if the relation alone doesn\u2019t identify a referent uniquely, or the relation is missing, the article might be required: i\u00b7equessi R\u00familo [WJ/398]. The Sayings of R\u00famil . The title refers to a specific composition rather than all utterances ever made by the author. ar mi cemen raine i\u00b7h\u00ednin [VT44/33]. And on earth peace, good will toward men . i\u00b7h\u00ednin stands for h\u00ednin Il\u00favat\u00e1ro . Note In a case if a noun refers to something whose possessor or origin is obvious (usually the subject), Quenya, like English, might use a possessive pronoun [TBD], as in: s\u00ed Varda ortane m\u00e1ryat Oiolosseo [RGEO/59]. Now Varda lifted up her hands from Mount Everwhite . A referent is identifiable when it is considered generally well-known or immediately unique (note that English often uses the article in such cases): imbi Menel Cemenye mene R\u00e1no tie [VT47/11]. Between Heaven and Earth goes the path of the Moon . R\u00e1no is not modified by the article, as the Moon is generally unique. man tiruva f\u00e1na cirya c\u00e1le fif\u00edrula? [MC/221]. Who shall heed a white ship while the light is fading? c\u00e1le is not modified by the article, as the light is a unique instance of a phenomenon for a given location. A referent is identifiable when it is a species or class in its entirety : eldar ataformaiti [VT49/7]. The Elves were ambidextrous . It is true for all elves, so the article is not needed. Note If a modifier limits the scope of the referent, the article might be used: zindar i\u00b7eldar Malariando [PE21/77]. Grey are the Elves of Beleriand .

In attributive position whether the head is definite of indefinite is undetermined, and the article modifies only the genitive: i\u00b7t\u00farin i\u00b7cormaron , i\u00b7cormaron t\u00farin the Lord of the Rings The rules of attributive genitive I above apply to attributive genitive II as well.

Nearly all verbs take at least one obligatory constituent, a subject . Subjects are marked by the common case (\u219230.2), and predicates agree with it in number (\u219227.1). Some verbs take only a subject: tintilar predicate i\u00b7eleni subject [RGEO/58]. The stars twinkle . i\u00b7arcanwar subject tauvar predicate [PE22/147]. The thrones endure . ulo subject \u00fava predicate [PE22/167]. The rain is coming . Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the direct object , which is also marked by the common case (\u219230.8); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called complements ): Varda subject m\u00e1ryat object ortane predicate [LotR/377]. Varda has uplifted her hands ; ilye tier object undul\u00e1ve predicate lumbule subject [LotR/377]. All paths are drowned deep in shadows ; ort\u00edrielyanna complement rucimme predicate [VT44/5]. We fly to thy patronage ; i\u00b7jarma subject tentane predicate Melcorello object [VT49/7]. The left hand pointed away from Melkor . Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object, which is marked by the dative case (\u219230.27); other verbs take a second complement in the common case: Varda subject enquantuva predicate i\u00b7yulma object nin indirect object [VT49/7]. Varda will fill the cup for me ; l\u00e1 navin predicate caritalya\u00b7s object m\u00e1ra complement [PE22/154]. I don't advise you to do so . In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, \u219226.16-23). Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are: prepositional phrases (consisting of a preposition and its complement): i subject or ilye mahalmar complement ea predicate [UT/305]. Who is above all thrones . adverbs : lende predicate tanna complement Nieliccilis subject [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le . subordinate clauses : savin predicate i Elessarno quetie naite object [PE22/158]. I believe that the words of Aragorn are true . The declarative subordinate clause (\u219241) fulfills the role of object with the predicate savin : compare Elessar in savin Elessar 'I believe Aragorn' . infinitive constructions : man subject cenuva predicate f\u00e1na cirya c\u00edra object [MC/221]. Who shall see a white ship leave . The common-and-infinitive construction (\u219251.21) fulfills the role of object with the predicate cenuva : compare and\u00fane in man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? 'Who shall see the last evening?' participle constructions : lie subject tatallaner predicate i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina object [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The common-and-participle construction (\u219252.13) fulfills the role of object with the predicate tatallaner : compare i\u00b7m\u00e1r in tatallanen i\u00b7m\u00e1r 'I marveled at the house' . When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a complex sentence . For complex sentences, \u219239. Note The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus fire die has a valency of one, anta give has a valency of three. Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb cire , when it takes only a subject, means sail , but may also take an object and then means cut . The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence. It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as tanna above , and with verbs which may have different valencies. In reality, syntactic 'obligatoriness' is better seen as a scale, with constituents being more or less obligatory depending on the verb and construction used. There are a few verbs which do not have a subject ('impersonal' verbs, \u219236), and very few of these take no other obligatory constituents (i.e. have a valency of zero). The sentence core then consists of nothing but the verb: e.g. \u00fala it is raining . 'Omission' of the Subject and Other Constituents That a verb takes a certain number of obligatory constituents does not mean that all those constituents are necessarily expressed every single time that verb is used. A constituent may be omitted if it is sufficiently clear from the context who or what is meant: roccor i\u00b7Erulingaron m\u00e1re n\u00e1r? N\u00e1r [PE22/166]. The horses of Rohirrim are good, are they not? They are . The second sentence has no explicit subject \u2014 'horses' has been the subject of the previous sentence and need not be mentioned explicitly again. Note that these constituents have to be supplied in translation ('they'). savin Elessar ar i n\u00e1ne aran Ond\u00f3reo [PE22/158]. I believe Aragorn, and that he was a King of Gondor . Elessar doesn\u2019t need to be mentioned explicitly again. \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende [PE22/166]. Close the door . English, too, normally omits the subject with imperatives. h\u00b7ore nin carita\u00b7s n\u00f3 namin alasaila [VT41/13]. I would like to do so but judge it unwise . Note how the second sentence has no explicit object, added in the translation ('it') 1 . The lack of an explicit, separately expressed subject is particularly frequent in Quenya, and constitutes a regular feature of the language. Information about the subject of a verb is then usually expressed by the personal ending of that verb: merin sa h\u00b7aryalye galasse n\u00f3 vanyalye Ambarello [MS/1]. I hope that you have happiness before you pass from the world . The subjects ('I', 'you') are expressed by the first- and second-person singular endings. melinye\u00b7s apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love him but not him (the other) . The subjects ('I') is expressed by the first-person singular ending, while the first object ('him') by singular object clitic. In the third person, the omission of the subject is regular if the subject of the previous sentence is continued, as in ( 15 ). If the subject changes, an explicitly expressed subject is normally required (VT49/14-15). In the first and second person, explicitly expressed subjects (in the form of the personal pronouns n\u00ed , ly\u00e9 , etc.) are used only for emphasis or contrast. For such 'contrastive' pronouns, \u219229.1-4. Note The omission of other elements than the subject (such as the object in ( 18 )) is much more restricted and infrequent than the lack of an explicitly expressed subject. The object can be substituted for a short clitic form which closely follows the verb ( 20 ) in third person only. Linking Verb, Predicative Complement A linking verb (or copulative / copular verb , copula ) 'links' a subject to a nominal constituent, the so-called predicative complement , which identifies the subject or assigns a property to it. The predicative complement is usually an adjective which agrees in case and number with the subject, or a noun which agrees with the subject in case (\u219227.7, 30.3). Examples of verbs that can function as linking verbs are na be , ole become , lare remain, stay , neme seem, appear to be, prove to be , etc. [ vanwa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb ] predicate Valimar subject [LotR/377]. Lost is Valimar . [ n\u00e9se linking verb n\u00f3rima rocco predicative noun phrase ] predicate [VT49/29]. He was a horse strong at running . Note Predicative nouns or adjectives are sometimes called 'predicate nouns/adjectives'. Predicative complements agreeing with a subject are also sometimes called 'subject(ive) complements'. Linking verbs also occur with an adverbial expression of place or circumstance as their complement: e.g. n\u00e1 be (somewhere), find oneself (somewhere) . But normally special verbs of position are used instead: tule get somewhere , hare stay somewhere . In many grammatical treatments, such complements are also seen as predicative complements: n\u00ed subject [ nauva linking verb tanome complement ] predicate [VT49/19]. I will be there . The verb n\u00e1 , unlike its English counterpart, doesn\u2019t occur in the meaning exist . An expression like tasse n\u00e1 'there is' can have only contrastive meaning 'but not here'. In the ' existential ' use, the verb ea with only a subject is used instead. The verb tule also has an existential use, and then means happen : vahaia n\u00f3re subject ea predicate i ga\u00b7esta Valinor [ MQ : PE22/124]. Far a way there is a land called Valinor . Some other verbs link an object to a predicative complement that agrees with that object (both are in the common). Examples of such verbs are consider X (to be) Y, make X Y, appoint X as Y (for more details, \u219230.10): alasaila n\u00e1 l\u00e1 care tai object mo subject [ nave verb m\u00e1ra predicative adjective ] predicate [PE22/154]. It is unwise not to do what one judges good . Note Predicative complements agreeing with an object are sometimes called 'object(ive) complements'. Omission of a Linking Verb: Nominal Sentences Frequently, a linking verb such as na is lacking in a sentence, whose core then contains only nominal elements. This occurs especially in the following cases: when predicative adjective follows the subject: i\u00b7roccor subject rindi predicate [ MQ : PE21/78].

Nearly all verbs take at least one obligatory constituent, a subject . Subjects are marked by the common case (\u219230.2), and predicates agree with it in number (\u219227.1). Some verbs take only a subject: tintilar predicate i\u00b7eleni subject [RGEO/58]. The stars twinkle . i\u00b7arcanwar subject tauvar predicate [PE22/147]. The thrones endure . ulo subject \u00fava predicate [PE22/167]. The rain is coming . Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the direct object , which is also marked by the common case (\u219230.8); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called complements ): Varda subject m\u00e1ryat object ortane predicate [LotR/377]. Varda has uplifted her hands ; ilye tier object undul\u00e1ve predicate lumbule subject [LotR/377]. All paths are drowned deep in shadows ; ort\u00edrielyanna complement rucimme predicate [VT44/5]. We fly to thy patronage ; i\u00b7jarma subject tentane predicate Melcorello object [VT49/7]. The left hand pointed away from Melkor . Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object, which is marked by the dative case (\u219230.27); other verbs take a second complement in the common case: Varda subject enquantuva predicate i\u00b7yulma object nin indirect object [VT49/7]. Varda will fill the cup for me ; l\u00e1 navin predicate caritalya\u00b7s object m\u00e1ra complement [PE22/154]. I don't advise you to do so . In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, \u219226.16-23). Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are: prepositional phrases (consisting of a preposition and its complement): i subject or ilye mahalmar complement ea predicate [UT/305]. Who is above all thrones . adverbs : lende predicate tanna complement Nieliccilis subject [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le . subordinate clauses : savin predicate i Elessarno quetie naite object [PE22/158]. I believe that the words of Aragorn are true . The declarative subordinate clause (\u219241) fulfills the role of object with the predicate savin : compare Elessar in savin Elessar 'I believe Aragorn' . infinitive constructions : man subject cenuva predicate f\u00e1na cirya c\u00edra object [MC/221]. Who shall see a white ship leave . The common-and-infinitive construction (\u219251.21) fulfills the role of object with the predicate cenuva : compare and\u00fane in man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? 'Who shall see the last evening?' participle constructions : lie subject tatallaner predicate i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina object [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The common-and-participle construction (\u219252.13) fulfills the role of object with the predicate tatallaner : compare i\u00b7m\u00e1r in tatallanen i\u00b7m\u00e1r 'I marveled at the house' . When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a complex sentence . For complex sentences, \u219239. Note The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus fire die has a valency of one, anta give has a valency of three. Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb cire , when it takes only a subject, means sail , but may also take an object and then means cut . The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence. It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as tanna above , and with verbs which may have different valencies. In reality, syntactic 'obligatoriness' is better seen as a scale, with constituents being more or less obligatory depending on the verb and construction used. There are a few verbs which do not have a subject ('impersonal' verbs, \u219236), and very few of these take no other obligatory constituents (i.e. have a valency of zero). The sentence core then consists of nothing but the verb: e.g. \u00fala it is raining .","title":"Predicate, Subject, Object, Complement"},{"location":"syntx/intro/core/#omission-of-the-subject-and-other-constituents","text":"That a verb takes a certain number of obligatory constituents does not mean that all those constituents are necessarily expressed every single time that verb is used. A constituent may be omitted if it is sufficiently clear from the context who or what is meant: roccor i\u00b7Erulingaron m\u00e1re n\u00e1r? N\u00e1r [PE22/166]. The horses of Rohirrim are good, are they not? They are . The second sentence has no explicit subject \u2014 'horses' has been the subject of the previous sentence and need not be mentioned explicitly again.

Elessar doesn\u2019t need to be mentioned explicitly again. \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende [PE22/166]. Close the door . English, too, normally omits the subject with imperatives. h\u00b7ore nin carita\u00b7s n\u00f3 namin alasaila [VT41/13]. I would like to do so but judge it unwise . Note how the second sentence has no explicit object, added in the translation ('it') 1 . The lack of an explicit, separately expressed subject is particularly frequent in Quenya, and constitutes a regular feature of the language. Information about the subject of a verb is then usually expressed by the personal ending of that verb: merin sa h\u00b7aryalye galasse n\u00f3 vanyalye Ambarello [MS/1]. I hope that you have happiness before you pass from the world . The subjects ('I', 'you') are expressed by the first- and second-person singular endings. melinye\u00b7s apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love him but not him (the other) . The subjects ('I') is expressed by the first-person singular ending, while the first object ('him') by singular object clitic. In the third person, the omission of the subject is regular if the subject of the previous sentence is continued, as in ( 15 ). If the subject changes, an explicitly expressed subject is normally required (VT49/14-15). In the first and second person, explicitly expressed subjects (in the form of the personal pronouns n\u00ed , ly\u00e9 , etc.) are used only for emphasis or contrast. For such 'contrastive' pronouns, \u219229.1-4. Note The omission of other elements than the subject (such as the object in ( 18 )) is much more restricted and infrequent than the lack of an explicitly expressed subject. The object can be substituted for a short clitic form which closely follows the verb ( 20 ) in third person only.","title":"'Omission' of the Subject and Other Constituents"},{"location":"syntx/intro/core/#linking-verb-predicative-complement","text":"A linking verb (or copulative / copular verb , copula ) 'links' a subject to a nominal constituent, the so-called predicative complement , which identifies the subject or assigns a property to it. The predicative complement is usually an adjective which agrees in case and number with the subject, or a noun which agrees with the subject in case (\u219227.7, 30.3). Examples of verbs that can function as linking verbs are na be , ole become , lare remain, stay , neme seem, appear to be, prove to be , etc. [ vanwa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb ] predicate Valimar subject [LotR/377]. Lost is Valimar . [ n\u00e9se linking verb n\u00f3rima rocco predicative noun phrase ] predicate [VT49/29]. He was a horse strong at running . Note Predicative nouns or adjectives are sometimes called 'predicate nouns/adjectives'. Predicative complements agreeing with a subject are also sometimes called 'subject(ive) complements'. Linking verbs also occur with an adverbial expression of place or circumstance as their complement: e.g. n\u00e1 be (somewhere), find oneself (somewhere) . But normally special verbs of position are used instead: tule get somewhere , hare stay somewhere . In many grammatical treatments, such complements are also seen as predicative complements: n\u00ed subject [ nauva linking verb tanome complement ] predicate [VT49/19]. I will be there . The verb n\u00e1 , unlike its English counterpart, doesn\u2019t occur in the meaning exist . An expression like tasse n\u00e1 'there is' can have only contrastive meaning 'but not here'. In the ' existential ' use, the verb ea with only a subject is used instead. The verb tule also has an existential use, and then means happen : vahaia n\u00f3re subject ea predicate i ga\u00b7esta Valinor [ MQ : PE22/124]. Far a way there is a land called Valinor . Some other verbs link an object to a predicative complement that agrees with that object (both are in the common). Examples of such verbs are consider X (to be) Y, make X Y, appoint X as Y (for more details, \u219230.10): alasaila n\u00e1 l\u00e1 care tai object mo subject [ nave verb m\u00e1ra predicative adjective ] predicate [PE22/154].

A significant overhaul of the chapter should be expected. Personal Pronouns Accented and Non-Accented Personal Pronouns 1 Personal pronouns are used only pronominally (\u219226.22-3). They are either accented ( stressed and emphatic ) or non-accented (for details, \u21927.1-2): to an extent, this distinction corresponds to a contrastive and a non-contrastive function. When describing the subject, and no (contrastive) emphasis is needed, the personal endings of the verb suffice. The unaccented pronouns are then only used in oblique cases . c\u00e9 tulis, tanome nauvan [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . No emphasis on the subject. nai lye hiruva airea Amanar [AUCT-LET/1963-12-18]. May thee find a blessed Yule . Unaccented pronoun in oblique case. Contrast signals to a listener that the utterance should be taken as one of several alternatives. Depending on their importance, contrast might be exhaustive or uncertain . Exhaustive is contrast where all relevant alternatives are covered, either explicitly in several clauses, or implicitly with entity present in the context: inye t\u00fale, apa isse \u00fane [\u2014]. I came, but HE didn\u2019t . All other alternatives (e.g. me not coming, or him coming) are explicitly dismissed. nai elye hiruva [LotR/378]. Maybe THOU shalt find it . Galadriel implicitly contrasts herself to Frodo, expecting never to come back to Valimar herself. Alternatives of exhaustive contrast are generally mutually exclusive. With an uncertain contrast the speaker is only making a claim about the referent of the pronoun and leaves it open whether this claim should or should not apply to the other referents relevant in the discourse: c\u00e9 tulis, n\u00ed nauva tanome [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . Whether anyone else will be there is left on the table. Unlike alternatives of exhaustive contrast, here they don\u2019t need to be exclusive. Another factor is focality . Some of the typical cases include clefts, answers to wh-questions, comparative constructions, focus constructions, etc: melinye s\u00e9 apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love HIM , but not HIM . The answer to a question: ' Whom do you love?' Main purpose of an accented pronoun in such position is to identify a referent as one of several alternatives, or to exhaust the set by dismissing all other alternatives: aistana elye im\u00edca n\u00edsi [VT43/28]. Blessed art THOU amongst women . Exhaustive pronoun implies that only Mary is considered. Tip The difference between stressed and emphatic pronouns then comes to differentiate between these two classes of contrast. Exhaustive contrast is denoted by emphatic pronouns, often appended in translation to English with only or even . Stressed pronouns are used then for weak, identifying contrast. However, this distinction does not always hold. First and Second Person First-person pronoun refers to a speaker, and in addition to number and accent distinguishes clusivity: listener can be either involved ( inclusive 'we') or specifically excepted ( exclusive 'we') from the context. unaccented stressed emphatic sg. ni n\u00ed inye pl. incl. we w\u00e9 elwe pl. excl. me m\u00e9 elme d. incl. wet w\u00e9t inque d. excl. met m\u00e9t emme Second-person pronoun refers to a listener, and has different levels of formality: unaccented stressed emphatic sg. familiar tye ty\u00e9 itye sg. formal lye ly\u00e9 elye pl. le l\u00e9 elde d. lyet ly\u00e9t este Note In colloquial speech, particularly of Men, plural exclusive form was sometimes used for first person plural in general.
