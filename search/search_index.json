For that we will exploit the distinction of semantic and pragmatic uniqueness as originally introduced by L\u00f6bner 1 and some generalizations made by Ortmann 2 and Schwarz 3 over weak-strong article splits encountered in many languages. Nominal Concept Types In his theory L\u00f6bner proposes a lexical distinction of noun types in how they classify the universe: [-R] nouns point to a member of a class: rock, architect, chair ; [+R] nouns require a [-R] noun to bound them to the scene: wheel, sister, head ; [-U] nouns might have several instances within the same scene: tree, brother, minister ; [+U] nouns pick out a unique memeber within the scene: Peter, weather, father . Lexical units have their default combination [\u00b1U][\u00b1R], but virtually each of them can undergo a type shift into any other combination: [-U] \u2192 [+U]: a rock \u2192 the rock ; [+U] \u2192 [-U]: the mother of a child \u2192 a late mother ; [-R] \u2192 [+R]: a book \u2192 my book ; [+R] \u2192 [-R]: the king of Spain \u2192 a king . Nouns which interpretation coincides with their lexical combination are then called nouns of this type, and which interpretation diverges from that combination are then called concepts of this type. The four possible types are then called: [-U] [+U] [-R] sortal individual [+R] relational functional Note The terminology distinguishes the noun's underlying type (eg. functional noun , FN) from its actual use (eg. functional concept , FC). Semantic vs Pragmatic Uniqueness It is crucial then to distinguish between individual and functional nouns on one hand which are lexically unique, and concepts which uniqueness results from the context (linguistic or extra-linguistic). In his work Ortmann claims that this distinction results in the fundamental split of the article use: concepts are marked in a more explicit way. It's especially easy to obseve such tendency in languages which show two types of definite articles \u2014 weak and strong \u2014 like German. The matter is not only complicated by the fact that articles tend to invade into other categories 5 , but also by fuzzy cases which could be analyzed either as semantic or pragmatic. The latter especially results in the article variation in closely related languages. Strong Article in Quenya The first major difference we can point between Quenya and English is the (non-)use of the article with unique nouns, where it is logically redundant: type Quenya English SN antanen hatal I case a spear RN \u2014 \u2014 IN anar caluva the sun shall shine FN lambe Eldaiva the language of the Eldar However, it occurs with unique concepts to mark the incongruence: type Quenya English IC \u00e1 sac' i fend\u00eb close the door FC i y\u00e1v\u00eb m\u00f3nalyo the fruit of thy womb Note Many languages diverge here from the Ortmann's statement where Quenya adheres to it: they use the weak (semantic) article in the immediate use IC like in the sentence above. Schwarz shows that the weak article is used without anaphoricity. The immediate use IC is pragmatic but non-anaphoric. L\u00f6bner's and Ortmann's uniqueness scale avoids to include immediate use IC altogether. The Threshold of Semantic and Pragmatic Uniqueness Some corner cases which don't clearly belong either to semantic or pragmatic uniqueness are: Bridging: \"John bought a book today. The author is French\". Autophoric nouns: \"He bought the car that was shown on TV \". Non-lexical FC: \" The highest mountain \". Non-Lexical Functional Concepts Non-lexical FC is a concept where semantic uniqueness comes about by syntactic structure and semantic composition rather than by the lexical meaning of the head noun. In particular, these are nouns combined with ordinal numbers , and with superlative forms of attributive adjectives. In these cases uniqueness is achieved by the lexical meaning of the modifier . Complex FC in Quenya Quenya superlative adjectives do not take the article 6 , and neither do the determining adjectives like last, next, only, same : m\u00e9tima hrestallo c\u00edra [MC/221] leave the last shore While no canonical example of ordinal number with a noun exists, they belong to the same category, and it is expected to observe a lack of the article with them too. Bridging Bridging or 'definite associative anaphora' (DAA) describes a noun, typically a functional noun, which is uniquely defined by its relation to a previously mentioned noun: I looked into the room . The ceiling was very high My new car needed repairing, the motor was broken I've just been to a wedding . The bride wore blue. Based on the world knowledge, the hearer knows that at a wedding, there should be one and only one bride, a room has only one ceiling and a car needs a motor. DAAs combine properties of pragmatic uniqueness (by virtue of anaphoricity) and semantic uniqueness (by virtue of involving a FN). It is therefore natural for there to be considerable variation in the use of articles. DAA in Quenya There's no canonical example of DAA in the current corpus of Quenya, but two sentences are close approximations to such: alcar mi Tarmenel na Erun ar mi cemen rain\u00eb i h\u00ednin [VT44/32]. Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good will toward men . 'The children' is definite in the reference to Eru. an c\u00e9 mo quern\u00eb cendel\u00eb n\u00famenna, i hyarma tentan\u00eb Melcorello [VT49/6-8]. For if one turned the face westward, the left hand pointed away from Melkor . 'The left hand' is definite in the reference to one . Note The first example Eru \u2192 the children is a 'relational anaphora', and the second example one \u2192 the left hand is 'part-whole' DAA. Even though Schwarz and Ortmann discuss how part-whole and maker-product DAAs differ in their semantic-pragmatic dichotomy in some languages, the examples above show that in Quenya any DAA is marked by the article. Autophoric Nouns Autophoric nouns establish their unique reference by a restrictive relative clause. Context-dependency affects the weak-strong article choice, but it seems Quenya in general requires an article uniformly (even when the relative clause is reduced) unless superceded by another determiner: \u00c1taremma i ea han Ea [VT43/12] our Father who art in Heaven manar i\u00b7ennor i me\u00b7kenner [MQ: PE22/124] who are the persons that we saw? caita mornie i falmalinnar imbe met [RGEO/58] darkness lies on the foaming waves between us Quenya as a Split I System The simplified scale of uniqueness suggested by L\u00f6bner and Ortmann: deictic SN < anaphoric SN < autophoric SN < DAA < non-lexical IC, FC < IN, FN < proper names where the cut-off position for the article use varies from language to language: English: deictic SN < [ anaphoric SN < autophoric SN < DAA < non-lexical IC, FC < IN, FN ] < proper names Quenya: deictic SN < [ anaphoric SN < autophoric SN < DAA ] < non-lexical IC, FC < IN, FN < proper names Data sentence gloss type prediction lassi lantar s\u00farinen the leaves fall in the wind IN \u2713 ut\u00falie 'n aure the day has come SN \u2192 IC (IU) \u2713 a laita t\u00e1rienna praise to the height FN \u2192 IC (DR) \u2713 alcar Oromeo the splendour of Orom\u00eb FN \u2713 anar caluva the sun shall shine IN \u2713 And\u00fane pella beyond the West IN \u2713 i y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo Y\u00e9sus the fruit of thy womb Jesus RN \u2192 FN (CA) \u2713 s\u00fale Manweo etsurinye the spirit of Manwe went out FN \u2713 \u00e1 sac' i fende close the door RN \u2192 IC (IU) \u2713 auta i l\u00f3me the night is passing SN \u2192 IC (IU) \u2713 caitas l\u00e1 i s\u00edr it is beyond the river SN \u2192 IC (IU) \u2713 c\u00e1le fif\u00edrula the light fading IN \u2713 TBD TBD TBD Journal of Semantics 4: 279\u2013326, 1985 \u21a9 Frames and Concept Types: 293-321, 2014 \u21a9 Two Types of Definites in Natural Language , Florian Schwarz, 2009 \u21a9 Journal of Semantics 28: 279\u2013333, 2011 \u21a9 as in Greek, where the article is used even with names \u21a9 PE17/91 \u21a9","title":"Definite Article"},{"location":"app/art/#definite-article-of-quenya","text":"The goal of this chapter is to explain the various asymmetries with regard to the (non-)use of definite articles in Quenya as compared to English.

Those relevant to Quenya include: intraterminality vs. nonintraterminality postterminality vs. nonpostterminality Marked members of the oppositions are items with the values intraterminality (+INTRA) and postterminality (+POST), implying the positive notion. Unmarked members are items with the values nonintraterminality (\u2013INTRA) and nonpostterminality (\u2013POST), implying negation of, or neutrality towards, the positive notion on a common basis of comparison. An item may also be naturally characterized by a certain value though lacking a competing item in the same temporal stratum, e.g. +INTRA\u00b0, +POST\u00b0. Intraterminality The most widespread viewpoint opposition in European languages is that of intraterminality vs. nonintraterminality. Intraterminality, +INTRA, envisages the event from an internal point of view: within its limits, after its beginning and before its end. +INTRA items view the event in its course and are unable to grasp it in its totality. In narrative discourse, this internal way of viewing events makes them non-propulsive, incapable of advancing a plot. Nonintraterminality, \u2013INTRA, as opposed to +INTRA, does not present the event from an inside point of view, but rather envisages it from outside, without special regard to limits. It neither expresses nor excludes completion, but tacitly suggests, unless the contrary is signalled, the occurrence of the event as an unanalyzed totality including the endpoint. This integral meaning makes \u2013INTRA items propulsive in narrative discourse. The \u00b1INTRA opposition is found in large swathes of Europe. The items signaling intraterminality show varying degrees of grammaticalization and generalized use. In many languages the \u00b1INTRA distincion is obligatory in the past tense. There are, however, also systems in which +INTRA items are used so restrictively that the opposing items seem to be rather neutral +PAST\u00b0 items. Degrees of Focality Intraterminals display higher and lower focality degrees. Focality concerns the concentration of the psychological interest on the situation obtaining at core \"now\". All intraterminals refer to events that are relevant within an interval, but they may differ with respect to the relative narrowness of the range of vision determined by \"nunc\". The 'presentness' is more or less focal: from the narrowest idea of an interval confined to the immediate proximity to broader ideas of an expanded and even infinitely expandable period of time. As a rough classification of 'presentness' ascribable to events going on at O, it might be assumed that the range of vision can be (i) narrow , (ii) expanded , or (iii) open . It may thus concern (i) uni-occasional events, basically confined to the immediate proximity of \u041e and actually performed there; (ii) uni- or pluri-occasional events, not confined to the immediate proximity of O, but actually performed there; or (iii) uni- or pluri-occasional events, in principle conceived as being valid in a regular or characteristic way, without being actually performed at the very moment of introspection. The tentative focality scale adopted here has three positions or cardinal degrees: relatively high focality ( HF ), relatively low focality ( LF ) and non-focality ( NF ). High-focal roughly corresponds to \"progressive\", low-focal to \"nonprogressive continuous\", and non-focal to \"habitual\". A lower item on the focality scale is semantically more general than a higher one. It may thus be used in cases that allow characterization in terms of higher focality or require a higher item in some other language. If a language has two items of different focality, the lower one may roughly cover ongoing events that are more precisely expressed by the higher one, e.g. English wrote \u2283 was writing . A relatively low +INTRA item in language A may cover situations that require a higher item in language B, e.g., French \u00e9crivait \u2283 English was writing . This is also true of items that are indifferent towards intraterminality, e.g., German schrieb \u2283 English was writing . Focality Oppositions Numerous European languages exhibit thoroughly grammaticalized focality oppositions. In the non-past stratum, English progressives express high-focal intraterminality within the opposition \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(+FOC)) is writing vs. \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) writes . In the simple past stratum, however, the high-focal is the only +INTRA item of the opposition: +PAST(+INTRA) was writing vs. +PAST(\u2013INTRA) wrote . The type is rather marginal in the overall European picture. Focality oppositions more frequently involve two +INTRA items in both strata. For example, Romance languages except French and Romanian employ, apart from their +INTRA\u00b0 Presents and +INTRA Imperfects, thoroughly grammaticalized devices signalling higher focality: \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(+FOC)) vs. \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) in Italian sta cantando 'is singing' vs. canta 'sings, is singing', and +PAST(+INTRA(+FOC)) vs. +PAST(+INTRA(\u2013FOC)) stava cantando 'was singing' vs. cantava 'sang, used to sing, was singing'. The +PAST high-focals are used rather extensively in the languages where they occur. The degree of focality signalled in the oppositions may be higher or lower. In some oppositions, the higher item basically stands for a narrow presentness and is not readily used for a expanded or open presentness, e.g., Icelandic \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(+FOC HF )) er \u0430\u00f0 lesa bokina 'is reading the book' vs. \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) leser b\u00f3kina 'is reading, reads the book'. Turkic languages of Europe display oppositions of a relatively low focality, e.g., Turkish -PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(+FOC LF )) yaz\u0131yor 'writes, is writing' vs. \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) yazar 'writes, will write'; +PAST(+INTRA(+FOC LF )) yaz\u0131yordu 'was writing, wrote' vs. +PAST(+INTRA(\u2013FOC)) yazard\u0131 'wrote, would write'. Intraterminality in Quenya In \u2013PAST stratum we observe the opposition of two tenses: \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) called aorist \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(+FOC)) called present In more than a few examples Quenya present was translated to English as Simple Present: i h\u00e1rar mahalmassen \"those who sit upon thrones\" [UT/305] elen s\u00edla l\u00famenn' omentielvo \"a star shines on the hour of our meeting\" [LotR/81] ar h\u00edsie unt\u00fapa Calaciryo m\u00edri oiale \"and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya forever\" [LotR/377] Tolkien explicitly discussed some difference between English Present Progressive and Quenya present : the latter could be used with non-dynamic verbs, unlike the former. [\u2013t, \u2013dyn] actional contents readily combine with +INTRA, but due to their lack of dynamicity they are infertile with +INTRA HF . Quenya present is then a low-focal item \u2013PAST(+INTRA LF ), and the opposition aorist vs. present is distributed akin to Turkish yaz\u0131yor 'writes, is writing' vs. yazar 'writes'. In +PAST stratum Tolkien provided several conflicting descriptions: version (a): past vs. habitual past version (b): past vs. imperfect vs. habitual past version (c): past vs. imperfect Version (a) presents us with general past of +PAST\u00b0 type (cf. Estonian tegi 'did'), indifferent to intraterminality. The habitual past forms are peripheral +PAST(+INTRA NF ). Version (b) separates habitual past based on participle from imperfect 2 : +PAST(\u2013INTRA) past vs. +PAST(+INTRA(-FOC)) habitual past vs. +PAST(+INTRA(+FOC)) imperfect , similar to Irish scr\u00edobh vs. scr\u00edobhadh vs. bh\u00ed ag scr\u00edobh , or Turkish yazd\u0131 vs. yazard\u0131 vs. yaz\u0131yordu . It's not possible to discern whether the focality of imperfect was high or low in this case, however. Version (c) mentions only imperfect 'more like aorist in syntax' and hints on it being fairly widely used. Together with the assumption that participle-based forms are not a part of later phase of Quenya, I propose that it was inteded to be a relatively low +PAST(+INTRA) item; compare the opposition with Italian scrisse 'wrote' vs. scriveva 'wrote, was writing, used to write'. Note that unusually no high-focal item like stava scrivendo is present in this system. To summarize the (non-)intraterminal items of Quenya and how they compare to English: Quenya English Aorist \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) goes \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) Present \u2013PAST(+INTRA LF (+FOC)) goes, is going \u2013PAST(+INTRA HF (+FOC)) Preterite +PAST(\u2013INTRA) went, has gone +PAST(\u2013POST(\u2013INTRA)) Imperfect +PAST(+INTRA LF ) was going, used to go +PAST(\u2013POST(+INTRA HF )) On Present with Non-dynamic Aktionsart : PE22/130 On Past Imperfect : (a, b) PE22/100-101, (c) PE22/157 Postterminality The next viewpoint opposition to deal with is that of postterminality vs. nonpostterminality. Postterminality, +POST, envisages the event after the transgression of its relevant limit: the beginning or the end, depending on the phase structure. Transgressing the limit means going beyond it and not only reaching it. +POST items may thus present an event from an orientation point outside its cursus. Nonpostterminality, \u2013POST, disregards this view. +POST focuses the attention on a situation obtaining beyond the relevant limit, where the event, whether totally or partially past, is still relevant in one way or another. While +POST has a natural affinity with the representation of past events, it is not equal to the feature +PAST. A \u2013PAST(+POST) item can, by virtue of its viewpoint value involve a component of anteriority, which allows it to compete with +PAST(\u2013POST) items in the simple past stratum. On the other hand, it does not signal remoteness in the sense of +PAST items. Focal +POST items typically remain in the realm of the given deictic centre and do not establish own deictic centres, as +PAST(\u2013INTRA) and +PAST(\u2013POST) items do. +PAST(\u2013POST) items are characterized by the absence of postterminality, which makes them more event-oriented and suitable as narrative pasts. Since their perspective is not tied to present that narrows the range of vision, they freely survey the flow of events and may refer directly, in a historical way, to an event at the very interval of its realization, independently of its relevance to any simultaneous or following deictic center. If a +PAST(\u2013POST) item is not intraterminal, it may present the historical event including its limits in an integral way, suggesting, unless the contrary is signalled, the occurrence of the event as an unanalyzed totality. Consequently, they are less compatible with markers of indefinite, unrestricted or generalized time ('ever', 'always', 'never', etc.) or with O-implying adverbs meaning 'already', 'not yet', 'just', 'now', etc. +PAST(\u2013POST) items are thus not \"simple Pasts\", usable for all past events. They differ considerably from items that may present past events both in a historical and a diagnostic way, e.g., Hungarian lopott , Maltese seraq , Turkish \u00e7aldi 'stole, has stolen'. Degrees of Focality Anterior items can be interpreted more or less diagnostically or historically. A diagnostic reading is \"now\"-oriented, focusing the attention on the current state and stressing the relevance of the event at this point. A historical reading is event-oriented, stressing the relevance of the event at the time of its realization. Similar to +INTRA operator, postterminality can rage from high- ('stative') to low- ('constative') and non- (historic) focality levels. Lower focality does not exclude higher interpretations. In many languages certain verbs possess special adjective-like forms, totally diagnostic +POST HF items expressing 'frozen' states without any dynamic element, e.g., English is gone , French est maigri 'is emaciated', Bulgarian e umoren 'is tired', Irish t\u00e1 briste 'is broken', Turkish as\u0131l\u0131d\u0131r 'is suspended', Georgian c\u0323eria 'scriptum est'. Whereas high-focals operate on transformatives, low-focals also operate on [-t] actional phrases. Low-focals can also have a relatively higher and lower position on the focality scale, implying more or less O s -relevance. Some of them, e.g., the Modern Greek and Armenian ones, are relatively high and used more restrictively than the English one, without being genuine high-focals. The relatively strong O s -dependence thus restricts the use of \u2013PAST(+POST LF ) items. One kind of current relevance is recentness , temporal closeness to O s . ni\u00b7ut\u00falie nyariello ve atarella \"I have just come from talking with your father\" [PE22/119] et\u00e9nie \"has just arrived\" [VT49/23] One possible kind of O s -relevance is resultativity , implying a change that has yielded a result present at O s , e.g., Modern Greek \u00e9xi \u00e9rthi 'has come (and is here)'. ap\u00e1rien parmanen \"I have learnt by means of a book\" [PE17/180] y\u00e9ni ve lint\u00eb yuldar av\u00e1nier \"the years have passed like swift draughts\" [LotR/377] A further kind of O s -relevance is the constative use, based on a conclusion at O s regarding the event. It includes the \"experiential\" meaning, which is considered to be one of the main PF functions, implying that \"a given situation has held at least once during some time in the past leading up to the present\". Error No constative examples in corpus Peripheral postterminal items Many components found in postterminals show a high combinability and also occur in constructions that indicate a 'dwelling in' or 'entering into' a posttransformational phase without functioning as viewpoint operators of the core systems. These less generalized peripheral items exhibit uses atypical of fully grammaticalized postterminal items and must be assigned +POST 0 values, as they do not compete with nonpostterminals in their respective temporal strata. As for prospective postterminals, \u2013PAST(+PRO(+POST 0 )) items instruct the addressee to situate the relevant limit of the event prior to an O 2 foreseen at O s . Correspondingly, +PAST(+PRO(+POST 0 )) items instruct the addressee to situate the relevant limit of the event before an \u041e foreseen at a past O 2 . illume e\u00b7kestanen/kestanelyanen, ni\u00b7tulle \"when/if he (had) asked me, I came\" [PE22/121] Postterminality in Quenya Quenya employs one core postterminal tense called perfect . In its description and gloss it has a clear 'recentness' connotation, and thus more closely correspond to similar item in Irish t\u00e1 tar \u00e9is leabhar a scr\u00edobh 'has (just) written a book', with more restricted use than English Present Perfect. Quenya also developped +POST HF items discussed above called perfective participles : vanwa 'gone', istanwa 'known', carinwa 'done'; as well as a few peripheral (non-obligatory) items in +PAST and +PRO strata. Warning Pluperfect QVS forms were made only from participles. The default assumption would be to discard it altogether like habitual past and future , as no form of ac\u00e1ri\u00e9ne shape is attested. However, non-participle past future perfect is attested and ill conceived without its counterpart in the past stratum. To summarize the (non-)postterminal items of Quenya and how they compare to English: Quenya English Perfect \u2013PAST(+POST LF+ ) has (just) gone \u2013PAST(+POST LF\u2013 (\u2013INTRA)) Perfective +POST HF is gone +POST HF Pluperfect +PAST(+POST\u00b0) had gone +PAST(+POST\u00b0(-INTRA)) Future Perfect \u2013PAST(+PRO(+POST\u00b0)) will have done +PAST(+POST(\u2013INTRA)) Past Future Perfect +PAST(+PRO(+POST\u00b0)) would have done +PAST(+PRO(+POST(\u2013INTRA))) On recentness of perfect : PE22/130 On perfective participle : PE22/106 Future TBD Quenya Tense-Aspect System Summary Quenya Tense Approximation English Aorist \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) Turkish Aorist goes Present \u2013PAST(+INTRA LF (+FOC)) Turkish Present goes, is going Perfect \u2013PAST(+POST LF+ ) Irish Perfect I has (just) gone Perfective +POST HF Irish Perfect II is gone Preterite +PAST(\u2013INTRA) Irish Preterite went, has gone Imperfect +PAST(+INTRA LF ) Italian Imperfect was going, used to go Pluperfect +PAST(+POST\u00b0) had gone Future \u2013PAST(+PRO\u00b0) will go, will be going Past Future +PAST(+PRO\u00b0) would go, was going to go Future Perfect \u2013PAST(+PRO(+POST\u00b0)) will have gone Past Future Perfect +PAST(+PRO(+POST\u00b0)) would have gone Lexical Aspect Tense and Aspect in the European Languages, pp. 27-189, 2000 \u21a9 Note that relative rareness of imperfect might have been a left-over from the previous version (a). \u21a9","title":"Aspect"},{"location":"app/taa/#aspect-in-quenya","text":"","title":"Aspect in Quenya"},{"location":"app/taa/#grammatical-aspect","text":"In his work 1 Lars Johanson investigated how the aspectual systems can be regarded as an interaction of a limited set of viewpoint markers.

Unmarked members are items with the values nonintraterminality (\u2013INTRA) and nonpostterminality (\u2013POST), implying negation of, or neutrality towards, the positive notion on a common basis of comparison.

Intraterminality, +INTRA, envisages the event from an internal point of view: within its limits, after its beginning and before its end. +INTRA items view the event in its course and are unable to grasp it in its totality. In narrative discourse, this internal way of viewing events makes them non-propulsive, incapable of advancing a plot. Nonintraterminality, \u2013INTRA, as opposed to +INTRA, does not present the event from an inside point of view, but rather envisages it from outside, without special regard to limits. It neither expresses nor excludes completion, but tacitly suggests, unless the contrary is signalled, the occurrence of the event as an unanalyzed totality including the endpoint. This integral meaning makes \u2013INTRA items propulsive in narrative discourse. The \u00b1INTRA opposition is found in large swathes of Europe. The items signaling intraterminality show varying degrees of grammaticalization and generalized use. In many languages the \u00b1INTRA distincion is obligatory in the past tense. There are, however, also systems in which +INTRA items are used so restrictively that the opposing items seem to be rather neutral +PAST\u00b0 items.","title":"Intraterminality"},{"location":"app/taa/#degrees-of-focality","text":"Intraterminals display higher and lower focality degrees. Focality concerns the concentration of the psychological interest on the situation obtaining at core \"now\". All intraterminals refer to events that are relevant within an interval, but they may differ with respect to the relative narrowness of the range of vision determined by \"nunc\". The 'presentness' is more or less focal: from the narrowest idea of an interval confined to the immediate proximity to broader ideas of an expanded and even infinitely expandable period of time. As a rough classification of 'presentness' ascribable to events going on at O, it might be assumed that the range of vision can be (i) narrow , (ii) expanded , or (iii) open . It may thus concern (i) uni-occasional events, basically confined to the immediate proximity of \u041e and actually performed there; (ii) uni- or pluri-occasional events, not confined to the immediate proximity of O, but actually performed there; or (iii) uni- or pluri-occasional events, in principle conceived as being valid in a regular or characteristic way, without being actually performed at the very moment of introspection. The tentative focality scale adopted here has three positions or cardinal degrees: relatively high focality ( HF ), relatively low focality ( LF ) and non-focality ( NF ). High-focal roughly corresponds to \"progressive\", low-focal to \"nonprogressive continuous\", and non-focal to \"habitual\". A lower item on the focality scale is semantically more general than a higher one. It may thus be used in cases that allow characterization in terms of higher focality or require a higher item in some other language. If a language has two items of different focality, the lower one may roughly cover ongoing events that are more precisely expressed by the higher one, e.g. English wrote \u2283 was writing . A relatively low +INTRA item in language A may cover situations that require a higher item in language B, e.g., French \u00e9crivait \u2283 English was writing .

In the non-past stratum, English progressives express high-focal intraterminality within the opposition \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(+FOC)) is writing vs. \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) writes . In the simple past stratum, however, the high-focal is the only +INTRA item of the opposition: +PAST(+INTRA) was writing vs. +PAST(\u2013INTRA) wrote . The type is rather marginal in the overall European picture. Focality oppositions more frequently involve two +INTRA items in both strata. For example, Romance languages except French and Romanian employ, apart from their +INTRA\u00b0 Presents and +INTRA Imperfects, thoroughly grammaticalized devices signalling higher focality: \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(+FOC)) vs. \u2013PAST(+INTRA\u00b0(\u2013FOC)) in Italian sta cantando 'is singing' vs. canta 'sings, is singing', and +PAST(+INTRA(+FOC)) vs. +PAST(+INTRA(\u2013FOC)) stava cantando 'was singing' vs. cantava 'sang, used to sing, was singing'.

Finite verbs can have a personal ending (@@) and express person or number, and can be modified by mood particles; nonfinite verbs do not have a personal ending and do not express person or mood. Categories Pertaining to All Verb Forms: Tense-Aspect All Quenya verb forms, i.e. both finite and non-finite forms (only participles), are marked for the category of tense-aspect . Tense-aspect : Quenya verb forms fall into three overarching systems, depending on which stem of the verb is used (@@); these three systems differ primarily in their expression of aspect: the aorist-stem system , covering the aorist, the preterite, the future; the present-stem system , covering the present, the imperfect, present active and passive participles; and the perfect-stem system , covering the perfect, the pluperfect, the past active and passive participles. Within these systems, tense is expressed by all forms. Aspect is not expressed by participles. Categories Pertaining to Finite Verb Forms All finite verb forms, in addition to belonging to one of the three tense-aspect systems, are also marked for the categories of person and number , and the category of mood . Finite verb forms express one of the following persons : apersonal form (used with expressed subject, @@); first person ('I'/'we (but not you)'/'we (with you)'); second person ('you'); or third person ('he/she'/'it', 'they'); And they express one of the following numbers : singular ('I', 'you', 'he/she'/'it'); plural ('we (but not you)'/'we (with you)', 'you', 'they'); in addition, Quenya has a dual number ('you and I', 'you two','the two of them', @@). Finite verb forms do not express moods , and those are realized as mood particles preceeding the verb (for the uses and meanings of these moods, @@). The following moods are recongnized: indicative ; subjunctive ; optative ; imperative . Finally, indicative forms can be split into basic forms (aorist, present, preterite, perfect, future) and derivative forms (imperfect, future perfect, future imperfect, long perfect (perfect continuous), pluperfect, future-in-the-past). Controversial Derivative forms are extremely rare and should be avoided. Categories Pertaining to Non-finite Verb Forms Non-finite verb forms are marked for the following categories: Infinitives are not marked for any category; Gerunds are marked for case; Participles express tense and voice, and, like adjectives, are also marked for the categories of case and number (\u2192 @@); Verbal adjectives are only marked for the categories of case, number and voice. Voice : all Quenya participle forms also express voice, treated in detail in @@. A basic two way distinction between different kinds of forms may be made: active forms; and passive forms. Morphological Building Blocks: Stems, Endings, and Other Markings Verb Stems and Tense-Aspect Stems All forms of a certain verb share a verb stem , which identifies the forms as deriving from that particular verb: for example, in any form of the verb talta (e.g. atalantiemma , taltuvante , talanter ), the verb stem talat- identifies the form as belonging to that particular verb (and thus expressing in some way the meaning fall ). Many Quenya verb stems occur in different variants due to ablaut vowel gradation (\u2192 @@): for example, the verb stem of the verb ort\u00e4 rise occurs as either ort- (zero grade), orot- (short grade) or \u00f3r- (lengthened grade). Different tense-aspect stems of such verbs differ in the vowel-grade they show. For verbs which have variant verb stems, all variants are given below, where required. Through the addition of endings, augments and ablaut, a tense-aspect stem is formed. The tense-aspect stem identifies the form as having a particular combination of tense-aspect. Six different kinds of tense-aspect stems may be distinguished; these fall into the three overarching systems described above (@@): aorist tense-aspect: aorist stems, past stems, future stems; present tense-aspect: present stems, imperfect stems; perfect tense-aspect: perfect stems. The mechanisms involved in forming tense-aspect stems from verb stems are detailed in the individual chapters on the present (\u2192 @@), aorist (\u2192 @@), and perfect (\u2192 @@) stems. Verbs lacking certain tense-aspect stems altogether are called defective verbs : for instance, the verb lir- sing lacks past-stem forms in classical Quenya, and verbs in -ea have no present forms at all. Thematic Vowels Some elements appear between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect stem ending : Many Quenya verb forms include a thematic vowel (or: 'theme vowel') a standing between the stem and the ending, e.g. ort a uva , hent a nie ; for details, @@ below. Endings Every verb form also has an ending , which provides the information required to identify the form as either finite or non-finite, and sometimes its voice, tense, aspect or mood. These endings are called primary . Note Most often such an ending is referred to as a suffix , but here this term is reserved for a derivative block of a new lexeme. By this definition, the derivational morphology of verbal adjectives, participles and gerunds like -it\u00eb is a suffix , but preterite -ne is a primary ending . However, for simplicity (particularly due to cases like future participle, where derivational suffix follows its primary ending), they are all discussed under the title of verbal endings. Some verbal forms can express additional information in their secondary ending : For finite verbs, the 'personal ending' expresses person and number; For infinitive, the 'possessive ending' also expresses person and number; The endings of gerund, participles and verbal adjectives might express case and number. The endings are treated more fully below, \u2192 @@. Augments and Prepositional Prefixes Finally, some elements precede the stem: perfect stems might include an augment, which takes the form of a root vowel 1 directly preceding the stem (e.g. e-c\u00e9nie ), or, if the verb stem begins with a vowel, either that vowel is lengthened (e.g. \u00falie ) or the syllable is duplicated ( or\u00f3rie ). For details, \u2192 @@. Many compound verbs begin with a prepositional prefix, an original preposition integrated into the verb form, e.g. ettul\u00eb , aucir\u00eb (\u2192 @@). These prefixes are always the first element of a form, preceding even augments and reduplications (\u2192 @@). A final consonant of such prefixes often assimilates to the following sound: e.g. eccez\u00eb but etec\u00e9zie (\u2192 @@). Assumption If the prefix ends in a vowel, this vowel usually drops out before another vowel (elision, \u2192 @@). Note For reduplications, \u2192 @@. Verbal Stems Quenya verbal stems split into seven major groups or conjugations : basic verbs : most numerous group of bare primitive \u221atal shape: cen- ( \u221aken ) see , tul- ( \u221atul ) come , mat- ( \u221amat ) eat ; long verbs : triconsonantal verbs of \u221atalat shape: talat- ( \u221atalat ) fall , carap- ( \u221akarap ) speak , sulup- ( \u221asulup ) drink ; vocalic-progressive or a-verbs : verbs with an inherently continuative sense of \u221atal-\u0101 shape: 'ala- ( \u221agal-\u0101 ) grow , fara- ( \u221aspar-\u0101 ) hunt , hora- ( \u221askor-\u0101 ) wait ; vocalic-inceptive or u-verbs : verbs often with an inherently inchoactive sense of \u221atal-\u016b shape (with or without a consonantal element): haru- ( \u221akhad-\u016b ) sit down , liru- ( \u221alir-\u016b ) sing , cainu- ( \u221akaj-n\u016b ) lie down ; formative verbs : verbs that add an additional consonant to the stem, usually of inchoactive or anticausative meaning, of \u221atal-t , \u221atal-j or \u221atal-s shape: cait- ( \u221akaj-t ) lie , siry- ( \u221asir-j ) flow , cals- ( \u221akal-s ) shine ; causative verbs : verbs with an inherently causative meaning that add an additional syllable to the stem of \u221atal-ta or \u221atal-ja shape: caita- ( \u221akaj-ta ) lay , tulta- ( \u221atul-ta ) send , tulya- ( \u221atul-ja ) lead ; derivative verbs : verbs formed from nouns or adjectives, with or without addition of derivative elements: tengua- read (from tengua letter ), remba- trap (from rembe net ), telconta- stride (from telco leg ). Together conjugations 2-7 are known as secondary verbs . Thematic and Athematic Conjugations Quenya verb forms are either thematic or athematic. Thematic forms include a thematic vowel a between the verb-stem and the non-finite or tense-aspect ending. Athematic forms do not include a thematic vowel: thus in athematic forms tense-aspect ending is attached immediately to the stem: class aorist preterite future present perfect I A A A A A II T A A A A III T T A A A IV A A A A A V T A A A A VI T T T T T VII T T A T T Some examples with a III conjugation verb with a stem far- hunt : faran : 1 sg. aor. thematic: thematic vowel a stands between the ending -n and the aorist-stem; f\u00e1ran : 1 sg. pres. athematic: the tense-aspect ending a is a part of the present-stem; faranen : 1 sg. pret. thematic: thematic vowel a stands between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect ending -ne ; faruvan : 1 sg. fut. athematic: the tense-aspect ending -uva is attached to the verb-stem directly; far\u00e1ve : ger. thematic: thematic vowel a is inserted before the gerundial ending; farite : inf. athematic: the infinitive ending -ita is attached directly to the verb-stem. Assumption No infinitive form but of basic verbs is attested. Endings Endings of Finite Forms The endings of finite verb forms are divided into primary , which mark tense-aspect, and secondary or 'personal' which mark person and number of its subject. Primary Endings Tense-Aspect Endings aorist present preterite perfect future -(\u00eb) -(y)a -(n)e -(n)ie -uva More details in @@. Imperative Ending To-Do Personal Endings The (a)personal endings of finite verb forms are the same for all stems: Apersonal endings mark only number , and they are used when the subject of the verb is explicit ; Personal endings mark number and person when the subject is left implicit ; In singular personal endings can be either short or long depending on euphonic environment. Tables of Endings singular plural dual apersonal \u2014 -r -t first-person incl. -n(ye) -lwe -nque, -ngwe excl. -lme -mme second-person fam. -t(ye) -lde -ste form. -l(ye) third-person -s(e) -lte, -nte -tte honorific -tar -ltar(i), -ntar(i) -star reflexive -sse -tte \u2014 To-Do What is the difference between optional variants? Endings of Non-finite Forms Primary Endings infinitive gerund active participle passive participle -ita -ie, -ve -(i)la -(i)na Note Participles express tense and therefore employ primary endings of both finite and non-finite forms : car-uva-ila that will be doing . They are not marked for aspect, however, so perfect ending is used for past tense , aorist ending for present tense . More details in @@. Possessive Endings Even though non-finite forms don't use secondary 'personal' endings to denote subject like finite forms do, they nonetheless can express it with substantive 'possessive' endings (\u2192@@): caritalya\u00b7s your doing it . For details, @@. Nominal Endings Gerund and participles function as nouns and therefore can receive a case ending . Gerund declines as a second-declension noun (\u2192 4.@@ ), and participles as a first-declension noun (\u2192 4.@@ ). To-Do The write-up is a bit lazy. Return to this section later. Augments and Reduplications Formation of the Augment Perfect-stem forms (though, not only) normally include an augment, which immediately precedes the stem. The form of the augment is determined by the initial sound of the (tense-aspect) stem. With Stems Beginning with a Consonant If the stem begins with a consonant, the augment takes the form of a root vowel : verbal stem perfect stem mat- a-m\u00e1tie tul- u-t\u00falie h\u00b7or- o-h\u00f3rie With stems beginning with strong n , m , ng 2 (\u2192@@), that strong consonant is restored: verbal stem aorist stem perfect stem ndac- nac\u00eb a-nd\u00e1cie mbar- mar\u00eb a-mb\u00e1rie ngor- ngor\u00eb o-ng\u00f3rie Late Tarquesta Eventually those forms were brought into line with aorist stems: nac\u00eb > an\u00e1cie , mar\u00eb > am\u00e1rie . As ng- became n- , it appeared as such: nor\u00eb > on\u00f3rie . With Stems Beginning with a Vowel or Diphthong If the stem begins with a vowel, the augment usually gets absorbed into it with the lengthening (and in lengthened-grade ablaut it disappears): verbal stem perfect stem ap- a-\u00e1pie > \u00e1pie ef- e-\u00e9fie > \u00e9fie ul- u-\u00falie > \u00falie Note A silent g- is purely an orthographic convenience. Stems with it behave like stems beginning with vowels: verbal stem gal- , perfect stem ga-\u00e1lie > g\u00e1lie . It is also common for some verbs (and more generally in verse) to use reduplication instead (see below, @@): Formation of Reduplications Frequentative and sometimes perfect stems are formed by the addition of a reduplication to the verb stem. Reduplications consist of a consonant + root vowel, and may substitute an augment with stems starting with a vowel. Three Types of Reduplication With verb stems beginning with a single consonant, ty- or qu- , strong nasals ( nd- , mb- , ng- ), or other palatilized consonants ( ny- , ly- 3 , j- ): reduplication = initial consonant + root vowel : verbal stem frequentative stem sil- sisilla tyal- tyatyalla ndac- nandacca nyar- nanyarra jam- hajamma With verb stems beginning with a combination of stop + s ( cs- , ps- , ts- ), voiceless liquid ( hl- , hr- ): reduplication = second consonant + root vowel : verbal stem frequentative stem psar- sapsarra csar- sacsarra hlas- lahlassa hris- rihrissa With verb stems beginning with a vowel: reduplication = root vowel + final consonant : verbal stem perfect stem is-t- is-\u00edsie ol- ol-\u00f3lie or-y- or-\u00f3rie Further Particulars Verbal roots of \u221at\u0101 shape frequently show inversion . When this happens, augment and reduplication follow regular 'consonant-first' form: verbal stem stem with augment au-t- < w\u0101-t a-w\u00e1-nie is-t- < s\u012b-t i-si-nte or-y- < r\u014d-j o-ro-nte The Relative Position of Augments, Reduplications and Prefixes Basic Rules Rules In compound verbs that include a prepositional prefix, any augment or reduplication comes after the prefix: entul- > en-u-t\u00falie . also known as sund\u00f3ma . \u21a9 The difference is more obvious in transcription schemas that use \u00f1- for initial ngoldo : \u00f1or\u00eb > ong\u00f3rie . \u21a9 If gy- > ly- , something to sort later. \u21a9","title":"14.

Fifth-Declension Nouns Stems and Types of Fifth-Declension Nouns All fifth-declension nouns have a stem ending in a consonant . Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different subtypes of the fifth declension are distinguished. The differences between these types largely depend on two factors: (type of) the consonant in which the stem ends; length of the vowel in the stem. It is often impossible to derive the stem of a fifth-declension noun (and thus the exact pattern of that noun's declension) from the common singular alone: the genitive is required to determine which subtype the noun belongs to.

Note In Late Quenya 14 final -t became -s , and subtypes (2) and (3) merged into one large group. Assimilated and Other Special Forms Nouns with simple bases have some distinct endings in the singular: bases on -m have genitive-adjective in -nwa , instrumental in -mnen ; bases on -n have genitive-adjective in -nwa , instrumental in - nwen , allative in -nna ; bases on -l have genitive-adjective in -lwa , instrumental in -lmen , ablative in -llo ; bases on -r have genitive-adjective in -rwa , instrumental in -rmen ; bases on -s have genitive-adjective in -rwa , instrumental in -rmen , locative in -sse ; bases on -t have instrumental in -twen . In addition to those, for some old nouns it is possible to encounter similar forms in other cases, which are, however, rarely used in later speech: in ablative : bases on -n , -r and -s can have -llo ; bases on -m can have -lmo ; in locative : bases on -l , -n and -r can have -lde , -nde and -rde ; bases on -l and -t can have -lse and -tse ; in allative : bases on -l can have -lda . Monosyllabic Nouns Monosyllabic nouns belonging to fifth declension can be divided into groups: strong nouns which keep long stem; weak nouns which keep short stem; mixed nouns which have long stem in common , but otherwise short .

Reminder Derivative and causative conjugations have only zero-grade stem (\u2192@@). The u-verbs don't have a short-grade ablaut. Basic and a-verbs use short-grade ablaut only in derivational morphology , but not as a part of tense conjugation. Thematic and Athematic Aorists Forms built on the aorist stem follow either a thematic or an athematic conjugation. thematic conjugation: all causative tense forms, aorist and preterite tense forms of derivative and a-verbs, aorist tense form of long and formative verbs. athematic conjugation: all basic and u-verbs tense forms, preterite and future tense forms of long and formative verbs, future tense forms of derivative and a-verbs. Late Tarquesta In preterite a-verbs became athematic : far-a- > far-ne . Tense Endings Tense endings are added after a theme vowel in thematic conjugations, or directly to stem in athematic conjugations. aorist tense endings: -\u00eb in basic, nil everywhere else. preterite tense ending: -(n)e . future tense ending: -uva . Exception The u-verbs might receive the aorist tense-ending when unmarked for number or person, but drop it before secondary ending: haru- > haru(\u00eb) > harun . Sound Changes in Tense Stems Several sound changes become apparent in aorist stems. The most important is metathesis (@@), discussed below. For rhotacism and other, more obscure changes, @@. Metathesis occurs in preterite tense of athematic conjugation, except for u-verbs, and might involve assimilation (@@): cat- > cat-ne > cante , tup- > tup-ne > tumpe , sulup- > sulup-ne > sulumpe .

The reasons for that vary, but all those verbs are usually easily recognized, and more importantly, they behave regularly within the selected conjugation. We can find: spurious u-verbs: they behave like basic verbs in aorist and preterite: micu- > aorist miqu\u00eb , preterite minque ; but like u-verbs in future: micu-uva > mic\u00fava ; spurious formatives: they behave like formative verbs in aorist and future: cay-t- > aorist caita , future caituva ; but like basic verbs in preterite: cay-ne > caine ; spurious s-verbs: they behave like formative verbs in aorist and future: cal-s- > aorist calarya , future calaryuva ; but like long verbs in preterite: cala-s-ne > calasse ; Spurious u-Verbs There are two types of spurious u-verbs: verbs ending in a velar consonant: micu- , nicu- ; defective basic verbs which were partially displaced by u-verbs: lir- , cel- . verb stem aorist tense stem preterite tense stem future tense stem nicu- niqu-\u00eb niqu-ne > ninque, nic-u-ne nicu-uva > nic\u00fava lir- lir-\u00eb lir-ne, lir-u-ne lir-u-uva > lir\u00fava The preference for a form in preterite is sporadic and varies from author to author. Spurious Formative Verbs The basic verbs ending in a semivowel largely blended with the formative verbs from the same historical root. Such verbs show variant forms in preterite: verb stem aorist tense stem preterite tense stem future tense stem cay-(t)- cay-t- a -\u00f8 caya -t-ne > ceante, cay-ne > caine cay-t-uva law-(t)- law-t- a -\u00f8 lawa -t-ne > loante, law-ne > laune law-t-uva law-(y)- law-y- a -\u00f8 lawa -y-ne > loanye, law-ne > laune law-y-uva The spurious verbs with y -extension were rare, but basic preterite for t -extension was regular. Late Tarquesta Eventually formative verbs were brought into line and became regular. Basic forms which persisted commonly transferred to long peterite (see below). Spurious s-Verbs Formative verbs with -s- largely merged with formative (a) conjugation, but have long conjugation in preterite: verb stem aorist tense stem preterite tense stem future tense stem cal-s- cala -s-y- a -\u00f8 > calarya cala -s-\u00f8-ne > calasse cala -s-y-uva > calaryuva Warning Spurious s-vebs have only short-grade ablaut form. Augmented Preterite A special group of formative verbs of \u221at\u0101 shape might form preterite from inverted root with an augment: is-t- > i-si-t-ne > isinte , or-t- > o-ro-t-ne > oronte . The resulting form is superficially the same as from short-grade ablaut: isi-t-ne > isinte , orot-ne > oronte . However, the augment is not a part of the stem, and can be freely omitted, especially if following a vowel (elision, @@): sinte , ronte . The vowel of a short-grade ablaut stem can't be elided. Long Preterite Some basic and formative verbs show a lengthened-grade ablaut in preterite: verbs ending in -b or -w : lab- > l\u00e1ve , tyaw- > ty\u00e1ve ; verbs ending in -d beside regular -nde sometimes reformed either after regular -r verbs to no-metathesis -rne : nid- > nirne ; or, more commonly, to long preterite: yod- > y\u00f3re ; verbs in -y beside regular -ine could have a long preterite form (see below): ray- > r\u00e1ie ; Late Tarquesta later verbs in -l also formed a long preterite: tul- > t\u00fale ; eventually such forms started to spread and become more common: car- > c\u00e1re . Long Future and Contract Future Basic verbs ending in -b or -w show an irregular future form depending on its root vowel: if root vowel is -o- or -u- , the future ending is -ua : tub- > tuvua ; with any other root vowel, the final consonant is dropped: lab- > la-\u00f8-uva > lauva . Verbs in -ea A small and rare group of verbs which show -ea in aorist tenses comprises basic verbs with stems in -ay and a-verbs ending in -e(g)a : verb stem aorist tense stem preterite tense stem future tense stem basic ray- ray-\u00eb > rea ray-ne > raine ray-uva vocalic a te(g)a- te- a -\u00f8 te(g)-ne > tenge te-uva Note Since basic verbs in -y became spurious, they typically show formative forms in aorist and future tense, but basic form in preterite: ray- > aorist raita , future raituva , but preterite raine (instead of regular formative raya-t-ne > reante ). But verbs which kept basic conjugation, commonly employed long preterite: ray- > r\u00e1ie , cay- > c\u00e1ie . Formative-Derivative and Causative-Derivative The derivative verbs which make use of additional suffixes like -t , -s or -ta technically belong to either formative or causative conjugation, except that just like derivative verbs, they have no ablaut . Verbs with addition of -s were spurious (see above): they had formative (a) forms in aorist and future tense, but joined long conjugation in preterite.

Accentuation is determined strongly by the length of the penult syllable of a word. For the purposes of accentuation: a syllable is long if it is closed, or contains a long vowel or a diphthong; a syllable is short if it is open and contains a short vowel.

Particularly these sections are designed to elucidate many of the 'irregularities' of Quenya morphology. Contrast, for instance, the following pairs of nominatives and genitives of some fifth-declension nouns: nom. sg. gen. sg. aran king arano vilwarin butterfly vilwarindo oron mountain oronto Such changes are found to have occurred consistently in certain environments at certain periods, and are therefore sometimes referred to as sound change 'laws' : for instance, the disappearance of [g] between vowels is such a law of Quenya historical grammar. Most of the apparent irregularities of Quenya morphology can be explained with reference to such laws, and it is therefore useful to have some familiarity with them.

Particularly these sections are designed to elucidate many of the 'irregularities' of Quenya morphology. Contrast, for instance, the following pairs of nominatives and genitives of some fifth-declension nouns: nom. sg. gen. sg. aran king arano vilwarin butterfly vilwarindo oron mountain oronto Such changes are found to have occurred consistently in certain environments at certain periods, and are therefore sometimes referred to as sound change 'laws' : for instance, the disappearance of [g] between vowels is such a law of Quenya historical grammar. Most of the apparent irregularities of Quenya morphology can be explained with reference to such laws, and it is therefore useful to have some familiarity with them. Reference to the sections below will be made throughout the morphology.","title":"Historical

The native writing systems for Quenya were devised by elves in Aman. The script of R\u00famil went out of use before the classical period. On the other hand, the script of Feanor was brought by Noldor after the Exile with them to the Middle-Earth, and there it was applied to a variety of languages. Other scripts include the runic script of Angerthas Daeron used by the elves in Eregion, and Latin, first used to transcribe elvish languages by the Anglo-Saxon traveler \u00c6lfwine . With that, Latin now is the most common script to write in Quenya. Tengwar Script We will discuss three main systems of tengwar as used in Quenya: as an abugida : each symbol is a consonant or a combination of consonants, followed by /a/; as an alphasyllabary : each symbol is a consonant or a combination of consonants; and as an alphabet : both consonants and vowels are drawn by independent symbols. Letters and Signs of Tengwar The tengwar is commonly represented by a table, consisting of twenty-eight regular shapes divided into four series and seven grades and additional twelve irregular shapes: I II III IV 1 t p k q 2 d b z ] 3 \\ f X { 4 g c ; [ 5 n m | } 6 a v F w 7 T P K Q Irregular Shapes 8 r R l L 9 s S h j 10 x y ' ` The values of these letters vary depending on the language, the time period and the mode . Tengwar as Abugida In the most common use each letter represents a consonant (or a cluster of them) followed by a sound /a/. Other vowels are marked as diacritics. Consonants The four series denote the place of articulation: I dentals, II labials, III velars, IV labialized velars. The grades in Parmaquesta period denoted the manner of articulation: 1 voiceless stops, 2 nasalized voiced stops, 3 voiceless fricatives, 4 nasalized voiceless stops, 5 nasals, 6 approximants. In Tarquesta some symbols changed their values or went out of use, so this system doesn't strictly hold true. The letters in Goldorin then read: I II III IV 1 /ta/ /pa/ /ka/ /kwa/ 2 /nda/ /mba/ /\u014bga/ /\u014bgwa/ 3 /sa/ /fa/ /ha/ /xwa/ 4 /nta/ /mpa/ /\u014bka/ /\u014bkwa/ 5 /na/ /ma/ /\u014ba/ /\u014bwa/ 6 /ra/ /va/ /a/ /wa/ 7 /sta/ /wta/ /\u03c7ta/ \u2014 Irregular Shapes 8 /ra/ /rda/ /la/ /lda/ 9 /sa/ /s\u02d0a/ /a/ /a\u02d0/ 10 /ha/ /ja/ /wa/ \u2014 Warning Note that hoP combination is pronounced /u\u02d0ta/. Vowels The vowels other than /a/ are marked by a diacritic sign over the letter: <a> <e> <i> <o> <u> after a consonant t te ti to tu initially, in hiatus h he hi ho hu long (a) j je ji jo ju long (b) \u2014 tE tI tO tU nasal |/ |/e |/i |/o |/u Additional Diacritics mark comment t/ no following vowel t@ special swashes for final consonants t < common combinations with /s/ t> gemmination tY palatal series and following /j/ tW following /w/ Recommendations for Print There is a great variation in orthography, as tengwar was never standartized. Here are a few guidelines for its use in a print medium: Use of letters with the same values: ` is still used to denote old voiceless liquids which disappeared in Noldorin. x is used initially and X medially: `ry /raj/, xn>o /han\u02d0o/, hX /aha/. a is used before a consonant, and r before a vowel: rjm /ra\u02d0ma/, keat /kerta/, aoto /orto/. y is used before a consonant, and FY before a vowel: FYvn> /javan\u02d0a/, yunen/ /ujnen/, yFY /aj\u02d0a/. ' is used before a consonant, and w after: 're /awre/, vil/w /vilwa/, n'we /naw\u02d0e/. F is only used with y\u00e1-tehta as /j/. Etymological spelling of initial w is not maintained. Etymological spelling of \\ is maintained. Late TQ Eventually the etymological spelling was abandoned, and \\ , X became used for /st/, /\u03c7t/, while the long-stemmed T , P , K were discarded. Use of marks: The swashes (or rince ) for the final /n/, /s/, and /r/ are not used. The anda-tehta and y\u00e1-tehta should be placed below the letter. To avoid mark-stacking issues, w\u00e1-tehta is not used. Tengwar as Alphasyllabary The only difference with the previous mode is that /a/ is not assumed after every letter. Instead, a special diacritic tA is employed, while t/ has no use. This mode was used in ornamental and decorated writing. Tengwar as Alphabet For their own writings Noldor developped a fully alphabetical system, where each vowel had their own symbol: <a> <e> <i> <o> <u> short F j h a ' long Fe je he ae 'e diphthong FI , FW jW hW aI 'I nasal F| j| h| a| '| Most notes from (@@) apply, except: y is used for /j/ consistently; w\u00e1-tehta is permitted; anda-tehta is replaced by e-tehta : le /l\u02d0/, ne /n\u02d0/. Latin Script Conceptually there are three different approaches to Quenya transcription: \u00c6lfwine's transcription, closely following Latin orthography; phonetic transcription; tradition of Lord of the Rings .

F has no Latin equivalent, but following y\u00e1-tehta is transcribed as <y>: FY <y>; tY <ty>; lY <ly>; nY <ny> etc. Nasal vowels are not commonly distinguished from long vowels. Sometimes appearing <\u0105\u0301>, <\u0119\u0301>, etc. are ambiguous. Warning Just like in tengwar, the spelling <pt> for P is conventional and not phonetical, since a word like <opto> is actually pronounced /o\u02d0to/. Traditional Transcription This method is mostly identical with phonetical transcription, but borrows a few conventions from classical spelling (TBD): <k> is spelled <c>; <kw> is spelled <qu>; <\u00fe> is spelled as <th> if (rarely) distinguished from <s>. nasal vowels are not spelled out; final /e/ is spelled <\u00eb>; the first vowel in hiatus is marked with diaresis: <\u00eba>, <\u00f6a>, etc. If the first letter is capital, the second one takes diaresis: <E\u00e4>, <O\u00e4>, etc. Modified Traditional Transcription While the phonetical transcription is well-suited to bridge the gab between tengwar spelling and use of Latin characters, the aesthetics of Latin spelling took an important place in devising the spelling for Quenya. Here we list some modifications to LotR spelling which ensure the Latin feel, but also provide a direct correspondence to the tengwar spelling: I II III IV 1 <t> <p> <c> <qu> 2 <nd> <mb> <ng> *<ngu> 3 *<z> <f> <h> *<hu> 4 <nt> <mp> <nc> <nqu> 5 <n> <m> *<g> *<gu> 6 <r> <v> *\u2014 <v, u> 7 <st> <pt> *<ct> \u2014 8 <r> <rd> <l> <ld> 9 <s> <ss> \u2014 \u2014 10 <h> <i> <u> *<h, h\u00b7> <\u00fe> is consistently distinguished from <s> and is spelled <z>: <azea> for <a\u00feea>; <\u00f1> is consistently distinguished from <n> and is spelled <g>: <goldo> for <\u00f1oldo>; the nasal vowels are marked with the following <g>: <tegma> for <t\u1ebdma>; <gw, hw, \u00f1w> are spelled <gu, hu, gu>: <tengua> for <tengwa>; diaresis is not used for marked vowels in hiatus or final /e/; diaresis can be optionally used to mark a short final vowel, particularly final /e/ and /o/ which turn into /i/ and /u/ in inflection: <sur\u00eb>, <ort\u00e4> as opposed to <orta>; diaresis is also used with <u> to distinguish syllabic quality: <huinde> birch , but <h\u00fcine> darkness <ht> is spelled <ct>: <nacte> for <nahte>; vowels stressed in violation of main stress rules (@@) can be optionally marked with a grave: <ov\u00e8a>; grave is also used to distinguish homonyms: <auta> go away , but <\u00e0uta> devise ; <runya> footprint , but <r\u00f9nya> red fire ; a running h (@@) is marked with middle point: <h\u00b7orro> alas .","title":"4.

Both widely diverge in the their views on the quality of short vowels. The first system, which I will label 'Piedmontese', poses that the quality of long and short /i/ and /u/ is the same a . The second, 'Calabrian', proposes that short vowels are more lax b . In this grammar, the 'Calabrian' system is taken to be canonical.

(E.) m un do , Lat. monstr um Phonetic Details Vowels are produced by the uninterrupted flow of air from the vocal cords through the mouth (as opposed to consonants, which involve a complete or partial interruption of the air flow, \u2192 1.11 ). The quality of a vowel (its sound) is determined by three factors: height (or 'openness'): the vertical position of the tongue relative to the roof of the mouth: for example, i and u are 'high' ('close') vowels, because the tongue is high in the mouth when they are pronounced; a is a 'low' ('open') vowel; backness : the position of the tongue relative to the back of the mouth: for example, i is a 'front' vowel, because the tongue is positioned towards the front of the mouth when it is pronounced; o is a 'back' vowel; a is a 'central' vowel; roundedness : whether the lips are rounded or not: for example, u and o are 'rounded' because the lips are rounded when they are pronounced; i , e and a are 'unrounded'. The quantity (length) of a vowel is determined primarily by the duration of its pronunciation, although there are often changes in quality between long and short vowels as well. Using these variables, the vowel system of Quenya may be represented as follows: Diphthongs Quenya has six diphthongs, combinations of two vowels that are pronounced in a single syllable. The second part of a diphthong is always either i or u . The resulting syllable is always long for the purposes of metre and accentuation; for details \u2192 2.5-6 . diphthong sound example approximation /aj/ [\u00e4i\u032f] /'lajre/ summer En. h igh , It. m ai /oj/ [\u0254i\u032f] /'cojre/ spring En. v oi ce , It. p oi /uj/ [ui\u032f] /'rujne/ fire It. l ui /aw/ [\u00e4u\u032f] /'rawko/ demon En. l ou d , It. au to /ew/ [\u025bu\u032f] /'kewra/ renewed It. n eu tro /ju/ [i\u032fu\u02d0] d /'sju\u02d0le/ incitement F. v iu li In diphthongs i and u were not pronounced exactly like the equivalent single vowels, but as sounds approximating 'semivowels' [j] and [w] (as in En. you and wave ); this was particularly the case when the diphthong preceded a vowel, in which case i / u was pronounced as a glide between the vowel sounds (as in En. hey you and new wave ). For the semivowels, also \u2192 1.25 . Pronunciation: Consonants Phonetic Details Consonants are sounds produced by the complete or partial interruption of the flow of air by a constriction at some point in the vocal tract: the Quenya consonants may be divided into the following categories: stops (labial, velar and dental stops), fricatives, liquids, and nasals (for semivowels, \u2192 1.25 ). Stops Stops (or plosives): sounds produced by the complete interruption of the flow of air. Within this category, three groups may be distinguished, depending on the place of articulation: (bi)labial stops /p/ and /b/: the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the lips together; dental stops /t/ and /d/: the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the tongue against the teeth; velar stops /k/ and /g/: the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the tongue against the back of the mouth; palatal stop /c/ e : the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth; labiolized velar stop f /k\u02b7/ (and in some treatments /g\u02b7/): the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth with a simultaneous rounding and protrusion of the lips; The stops may be further divided between: voiced stops /b/, /d/, /g/: the vocal cords vibrate; voiceless stops /p/, /t/, /k/, /c/ and /k\u02b7/: the vocal cords do not vibrate; The following are the eight stops of Quenya: stop sound example approximation notes Labial Stops /p/ [p] /' p arma/ book En. s p a /b/ [b] /'am b o/ hill En. o b ey , Ru. \u0440\u044b \u0431 \u0430 only after /m/ Dental Stops /t/ [t\u033a] /' t a\u02d0ri/ queen En. hospi t al /d/ [d\u033a] /'ar d a/ realm En. d ash , Fi. si d os only after /n/, /l/ and /r/ Velar Stops /k/ [k] /' k a\u02d0le/ light En. s k ate [k\u02b7] /'al k wa/ swan La. qu od medially before /w/ /g/ [g] /'a\u014b g a/ iron En. g ood , Ru. \u0433 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c only after /\u014b/ [g\u02b7] /'u\u014b g we/ web La. lin gu a between /\u014b/ and /w/ Palatal Stop /c/ [c\u031f] /' c a\u02d0ve/ taste Hu. ty \u00fak , Ic. gj \u00f3la Labiolized Velar Stop /k\u02b7/ [k\u02b7] /' k\u02b7 et\u02d0a/ word La. qu od Further Notes Stops /p/, /t/, /k/ don't show marked aspiration g like in En. pot , top and cat . Before a stressed vowel they're more tense. The Quenya dental sounds (which also include /n/, /l/, /r/, see below) represented sounds much closer to the comparable sound in English, as both had alveolar , and not dental (like in Romance languages), articulation h : the tip of the tongue makes contact with the gum-ridge behind the upper teeth rather than with the teeth themselves. Perhaps velars showed some fronting j [k\u031f], [g\u031f] before /e/ and /i/ to a degree similar to English thick (weaker than in En. key ). It is also reasonable to assume that velarized [k\u02b7], [g\u02b7] appear before rounded vowels /o/ and /u/. Fricatives Fricatives : sounds produced by 'squeezing' air through a constriction at some point in the mouth. Quenya fricatives are diverse, but even though just like stops, they may be voiced and voiceless, only one voiced fricative actually survived. labio-dental fricatives /f/ and /v/: the flow of air is obstructed by pressing the upper teeth against the lower lip; velar fricatives /\u03c7/ and /x\u02b7/ k : the flow of air is obstructed by pressing the tongue against the back of the mouth (with a simultaneous rounding and protrusion of the lips in case of /x\u02b7/); palatal fricative /\u00e7/ l : the flow of air is obstructed by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth; glottal fricative /h/ represents a rough breathing; sibilants /s/ and /\u0283/ m : the flow of air is obstructed by pressing the tongue against the gums; The following are the eight fricatives of Quenya: fricative sound example approximation notes Labio-Dental Fricatives /f/ [f] /' f ende/ door En. f ont /v/ [v] /' v ala/ god En. v ale Velar Fricatives /\u03c7/ [\u03c7] /'na \u03c7 te/ wound Ge.

The hissing effect in this variety of s is very strong. Resonants The category of resonants consists of the nasal consonants /m/, /n/ and /\u014b/, the so-called 'liquids' /l/ and /r/, and 'semivowels' /j/ and /w/. Nasals : the air flow is completely obstructed in the mouth, but flows through the nose. The Quenya alphabet has four nasals (all voiced): a labial nasal, /m/: the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the lips together; air escapes throughthe nose; a dental nasal, /n/: the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the tongue against the teeth or gums; air escapes through the nose; a palatal nasal, /\u0272/ p : the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth; air escapes through the nose; avelar nasal, /\u014b/: the flow of air is interrupted by pressing the tongue against the back of the mouth; air escapes through the nose. nasal sound example approximation Labial Nasal /m/ [m] /' m elo/ honey En. ha m , It. m ondo , Ru. \u043c \u0443\u0436 Dental Nasal /n/ [n\u033a] /' n a\u02d0mo/ judge En. n ice , It. n a n o Palatal Nasal /\u0272/ [\u0272] /' \u0272 a\u02d0re/ tale It. ba gn o , Du. ora nj e Velar Nasal /\u014b/ [\u014b] /' \u014b alta/ reflection En. si ng , It. a n che Liquids : two Quenya letters belong to the class of liquids /l/ and /r/: a lateral consonant, /l/ q : air escapes along the sides of the tongue, but not through the middle of the mouth; a rhotic consonant (or 'tremulant'), /r/: this was pronounced as a rolling, 'alveolar trill' sound, with the tongue vibrating against the gums. liquid sound example approximation notes Lateral /l/ [l\u02b2] a) /'fe l ja/ mine b) /'este l / hope c) /'ke l va/ animal Ru. \u043b \u0451\u0434 a) before /j/ b) finally after /e/, /i/ c) between /e/, /i/ and a consonant [l\u0325] /'pa l ta/ palm before /p/, /t/, /k/, /c/, /k\u02b7/, /s/ [l\u033a] /' l ajma/ plant It. l etto in other positions Trill /r/ [r\u0325] /'o r to/ mountain before /p/, /t/, /k/, /c/, /k\u02b7/ [r\u033a] /' r awko/ demon It. nuo r a in other positions Semivowels : the air flow is narrowed in the mouth, but not as constricted as with fricatives. There are two semivowels in Quenya: a palatal semivowel, /j/: the flow of air is narrowed by the tongue at the roof of the mouth; a labial semivowel, /w/: the flow of air is narrowed by the lips. liquid sound example approximation notes Palatal Semivowel /j/ [j\u030a] /'la c ja/ opening En. p u re after /p/, /c/ [i\u032f] /'la j re/ summer cf.

Diphthongs in a diphthong [w] /'fan w a/ veil En. w eep , It. u omo in other positions Further Notes The unvoicing is 'partial' r : the voicing occurs during only part of the sound (i.e. has a short duration). Hense a more precise realization of /pj/ and /rt/ would be [p\u207dj\u030a] and [r\u030a\u207et] . In any case, the direction of unvoicing is not marked here for being predictable. Geminates Most of the consonants discussed above can be doubled (so-called ' geminates '), e.g. nn, rr, tt : these stand for 'lengthened' versions of the same sounds(cf. the pronunciation of English compounds such as u nn amed, par t-t ime ). Geminates affect the metrical quantity of a syllable: thus e.g. the second syllable of indemma mind-picture is long for the purpose of metre, even though the e is a short vowel. Sandhi As Quenya is a language with strict phonotactics (the rules of sound combinatorics), it is no surprise that in speech when words come in contact they can be altered to make for more befitting flow. Such changes which happen on the boundaries between words or morphemes are called sandhi . For Quenya that includes: removal of final vowels; assimilation to place of final consonants; insertion of consonants after a final vowel. This section will not include various allophonic assimilations, however, as those are inferrable from the pronunciation tables. Elision Most short vowels at the end of a word may be dropped before a word beginning with a vowel or diphthong; this is called elision . That a vowel has been elided might be indicated by an apostrophe ('): zac' i\u00b7fende (= zac\u00eb i\u00b7fende ) Elision is often not expressed to the eye except in poetry. Available materials are very inconsistent, but even where the elision is not expressed, it seems to have occurred in speaking. Elision affects only unimportant words or syllables, such as particles, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions of two syllables, and the final syllables of nouns, pronouns, and verbs. The first vowel of a word may be elided when it follows a word ending in a vowel. This is called ' prodelision ' or 'aphaeresis'. The clear occurances in Quenya include only: conjunction 'r < ar : cuita'r par\u00eb article 'n < in : ut\u00falie'n aure Note Conversely, orava (o)messe can be another case of aphaeresis. In words with final u the elision does not occur. It also doesn't seem to occur with final i before e : EXAMPLES Assimilation 'Movable' Consonants Updated from vangwe . \u21a9","title":"1.

The quality of a vowel (its sound) is determined by three factors: height (or 'openness'): the vertical position of the tongue relative to the roof of the mouth: for example, i and u are 'high' ('close') vowels, because the tongue is high in the mouth when they are pronounced; a is a 'low' ('open') vowel; backness : the position of the tongue relative to the back of the mouth: for example, i is a 'front' vowel, because the tongue is positioned towards the front of the mouth when it is pronounced; o is a 'back' vowel; a is a 'central' vowel; roundedness : whether the lips are rounded or not: for example, u and o are 'rounded' because the lips are rounded when they are pronounced; i , e and a are 'unrounded'.

Available materials are very inconsistent, but even where the elision is not expressed, it seems to have occurred in speaking. Elision affects only unimportant words or syllables, such as particles, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions of two syllables, and the final syllables of nouns, pronouns, and verbs. The first vowel of a word may be elided when it follows a word ending in a vowel. This is called ' prodelision ' or 'aphaeresis'. The clear occurances in Quenya include only: conjunction 'r < ar : cuita'r par\u00eb article 'n < in : ut\u00falie'n aure Note Conversely, orava (o)messe can be another case of aphaeresis.

The Quenya equivalent of an indefinite article is the lack of an article: nai elen siluva lyenna [VT49/40]. May a star shine upon you . luini tellumar yassen tintilar i\u00b7eleni [RGEO/58]. Blue domes in which twinkle the stars . The article is 'definite' because it refers to someone/something that is identifiable : the article expresses that it is clear who/what is meant, and that it can be distinguished from other people/things. The article is also 'pragmatic' because it modifies what is identifiable only contrary to common knowledge: when distinguished from a context alone, article is usually omitted. Warning Quenya often doesn\u2019t use the definite article where English would (see examples below). The lack of an article in prose is normally significant, but in poetry the article is omitted much more freely: i\u00b7oromardi tanna lende ar wingildi wilwarindie The wood-spirits and the foam-like butterflies came thither [PE16/96]. The prose version would include definite i\u00b7wingildi instead. Reasons for Pragmatic (Marked) Identifiability of a Referent The referent of a noun is usually identifiable when it has been mentioned before : onortanen rocco. I\u00b7rocco n\u00f3rima n\u00e9 [modified; PE17/168, VT49/29]. I rode a horse. The horse was strong at running . A referent is identifiable when it is made specific by the immediate context : \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende, mecin [PE22/166]. Close the door, please . There\u2019s only one open door in the room. auta i\u00b7l\u00f3me [MC/222]. The night is passing! The night right now . aistana i y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo Y\u00e9sus [VT43/27]. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus . i\u00b7y\u00e1ve becomes identifiable through the information added in the apposition. The article is used if the noun is conceptualized and doesn\u2019t refer to a specific referent: epetai i\u00b7jarma \u00fa ten ulca s\u00edmaryassen [VT49/8]. The left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations . i\u00b7jarma doesn\u2019t refer to a specific left hand, but to a concept of the left hand. Reasons for Semantic (Unmarked) Identifiability of a Referent A referent is identifiable when it is obvious from the immediate context of its relation to another noun (note that English uses the article in many such cases): an c\u00e9 mo querne cendele n\u00famenna [VT49/8]. For if one turned the face westward . cendele is defined uniquely as belonging to a subject of the sentence. However if the relation alone doesn\u2019t identify a referent uniquely, or the relation is missing, the article might be required: i\u00b7equessi R\u00familo [WJ/398]. The Sayings of R\u00famil . The title refers to a specific composition rather than all utterances ever made by the author. ar mi cemen raine i\u00b7h\u00ednin [VT44/33]. And on earth peace, good will toward men . i\u00b7h\u00ednin stands for h\u00ednin Il\u00favat\u00e1ro . Note In a case if a noun refers to something whose possessor or origin is obvious (usually the subject), Quenya, like English, might use a possessive pronoun [TBD], as in: s\u00ed Varda ortane m\u00e1ryat Oiolosseo [RGEO/59]. Now Varda lifted up her hands from Mount Everwhite . A referent is identifiable when it is considered generally well-known or immediately unique (note that English often uses the article in such cases): imbi Menel Cemenye mene R\u00e1no tie [VT47/11]. Between Heaven and Earth goes the path of the Moon . R\u00e1no is not modified by the article, as the Moon is generally unique. man tiruva f\u00e1na cirya c\u00e1le fif\u00edrula? [MC/221]. Who shall heed a white ship while the light is fading? c\u00e1le is not modified by the article, as the light is a unique instance of a phenomenon for a given location. A referent is identifiable when it is a species or class in its entirety : eldar ataformaiti [VT49/7]. The Elves were ambidextrous . It is true for all elves, so the article is not needed. Note If a modifier limits the scope of the referent, the article might be used: zindar i\u00b7eldar Malariando [PE21/77]. Grey are the Elves of Beleriand . It is not implied to be true for all the elves in general. The article doesn\u2019t precede mass nouns and noun commonly used in plural: linte yuldar lisse-miruv\u00f3reva [RGEO/58]. Swift draughts of the sweet mead . man hlaruva ninqui carcar yarra [MC/221]. Who shall hear the white rocks snarling . A noun usually also doesn\u2019t have the article when it refers to an abstract concept : alcar Orom\u00e9va [WJ/369]. The splendor of Orome . Proper names rarely have an article, unless composed out of a single common noun : Arwen vanimelda, nam\u00e1rie [LotR/352]. Arwen beautiful and beloved, farewell . i\u00b7H\u00e9ru aselye [VT43/28]. The Lord is with thee . The article is not used with nouns modified by demonstrative and possessive pronouns , quantifiers , or determiner adjectives such as m\u00e9tima the last : To-Do Is the article used before superlatives? PE17/91 says 'no', but PE21/78 says 'yes'. vanda sina termaruva Elenna-n\u00f3reo alcar enyalien [UT/305]. This oath shall stand in memory of the glory of the Land of the Star . nai amanya onnalya ter coivierya [VT49/41]. May your child be blessed throughout his life . man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? [MC/222]. Who shall see the last evening? A predicative complement (\u2192 26.8-11 ) normally does not have the article, as it generally introduces new information. However, it has the article when it is identifiable for one of the reasons given above: n\u00e9se n\u00f3rima rocco [VT49/29]. He was a horse strong at running . mana i\u00b7coimas eldaron? [VT49/41]. What is the 'coimas' of the Eldar? coimas is conceptualized. Relative Position of Article, Head and Modifiers in a Noun Phrase Attributive and Predicative Position When the head of a noun phrase is modified by the article and one or more other modifiers (adjectives, pronouns, participles, \u2192 26.16-17 ), two different orderings of article, head and modifier can be distinguished: so-called attributive position (the modifier is between the article and the head): i m\u00e1ra n\u00e9r the good man ; so-called predicative position (the modifier is after the head, or before the article): i\u00b7n\u00e9r m\u00e1ra , m\u00e1ra i\u00b7n\u00e9r the man, being good, \u2026 (or: the man is good ). Note In poetry the distinction is not strict, and head-modifier order can be attributive: i\u00b7fairi n\u00e9ce ringa s\u00famaryasse [MC/221]. The pale phantoms in her cold bosom . Tip The general difference between attributive and predicative position may be described in the following way: a modifier in attributive position typically serves to identify the referent of the head noun (cf. e.g. En. the good man , as opposed to any other man); a modifier in predicative position is not used to identify the referent. Rather, adjectives and participles in predicative position say something about the condition the referent is in (cf. En. I drink my coffee black , They found the premises deserted ). The predicative position is always used for predicative complements with linking verbs \u2192 26.8-9 . However, there are various kinds of modifiers for which the distinction between the positions outlined above does not hold. These are treated below, \u2192 28.17-19 . Attributive Genitives I and II Most attributive genitives @@ can occur in both positions: valaron arcanwar , arcanwar valaron the trones of the Valar . Note The difference between the two constructions appears to be that in attributive position, the genitive I is presented as (more) vital for the identification of the head noun (for example, when the Valar are contrasted with another people, the attributive position will be used). But often the distinction is slight. In attributive position whether the head is definite of indefinite is undetermined, and the article modifies only the genitive: i\u00b7t\u00farin i\u00b7cormaron , i\u00b7cormaron t\u00farin the Lord of the Rings The rules of attributive genitive I above apply to attributive genitive II as well. However, it also can be treated as a quasi-adjective (for details, @@), not modified by the article, which then stands for the whole noun phrase: i\u00b7tyulma ciryava [PE21/80]. The mast of the ship . l\u00edrinen \u00f3mo i aire t\u00e1r\u00edva [PE17/76]. By the song of the voice of the holy queen . Note In each of these uses, modifiers in 'predicative' position actually do not have predicative function (for predicative function, \u2192 26.8-11 , 28.14 ). The terminology is therefore somewhat misleading, and should be taken to refer merely to word order. Pronominal Uses of the Article In a few highly specific uses the article has a pronominal function (i.e. serves as a noun phrase by itself, \u2192 26.15 ). The article can be used as a 3rd person object instead of se , sa (compare with English it and that ): v\u00e1 caris i [PE22/162]. He is not to do this . The article might be used as a relative pronoun in a common case : i\u00b7Eru i or ilye mahalmar ea tennoio [UT/305] The One who is above all thrones for ever . \u00c1taremma i ea h\u00b7an Ea [VT43/12] Our Father who art in Heaven . Or as a head of autonomous relative clause (for details, [REF]): l\u00e1 carita i hamil m\u00e1ra alasaila n\u00e1 [PE22/154]. Not to do what you judge good would be unwise .

In the overview below, the most important uses of each of the cases are listed, organized by syntactic function. The prepositions are treated separately, \u219231. Common The common case combines functions of historically separate nominative and accusative cases. As Nominative for Obligatory Constituent with Verbs The nominative is the case used for the subject of a finite verb (and any modifiers that agree with it, \u219227.7). Predicative complements with linking verbs (\u219226.8) agree with their subject (\u219227.7), and thus also stand in the nominative. Other Uses of Nominative The nominative is used with some most common prepositions as there default choice (\u219231). The nominative is also used in bare lists (\u219226.29), including entries in dictionaries. For the nominative used in apposition to a sentence , \u219227.14. The nominative is also used as a vocative : in calls or summonses to attract the attention of a person nearby, or of a god; in addresses, to acknowledge or maintain contact with some person nearby. Note When vocative stands in apposition to a noun, the case of that noun is applied, however. As Accusative for Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs) The accusative is the standard case for the direct object with verbs which take an object (\u219226.3). The following verbs (\u219226.12) take a direct object and a predicative complement that agrees with that object (and thus also stands in the accusative; this is often called a 'double accusative'). The accusative is also used in the accusative-and-infinitive (\u219251), the accusative absolute (\u219252) and accusative-and-participle constructions (\u219252). As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Time when , or within which , is expressed by either locative or accusative: umbe nin i hr\u00edve nauva urra si loa [PE22/168]. I have a feeling that winter will be bad this year. Accusative can also denote the spatial measure ( how long? how broad? ), especially with numerals: talion lempe halda n\u00e1 i\u00b7ando [translated; TAI/150]. Five foot high is the door . Genitive The main function of the genitive is at the level of the noun phrase, to mark attributive modifiers (i.e. expressing various relations between (pro)nouns/noun phrases). It is also used to mark some required constituents (complements) with adjectives, and functions in a few adverbial expressions. Quenya distinguishes two genitival cases: genitive I or partitive and genitive II or adjective 1 . As Modifier in a Noun Phrase: the Attributive Genitive The genitive is used particularly within noun phrases, to mark a noun phrase or pronoun as modifier of a head (\u219226.18). Traditionally, many different categories within this attributive genitive use are distinguished; the most important of these are given below: The genitive of possession denotes ownership, belonging, etc.; The genitive of origin denotes the origin, offspring, source, etc. of the head; With nouns that express an action ('action nouns', \u219223.6), the genitive is used for the subject or object of that action \u2014 genitive of the subject (or 'subjective' genitive) or of the object (or 'objective' genitive); Other relations between nouns: material/contents, price/value, elaboration, etc. Genitive of possession distinguishes alienable (which can be given away or lost) and inalienable (perpetual and inherent to the head) possession. Concepts comprising inalienable possession include: body parts: r\u00e1mar aldaron , hon maro ; part-whole relations: tyulma ciryo , aicasse Taniquetildo ; kinship terms: amille Hristo , indis i\u00b7ciryamo ; various social relations: ingwe ingweron , aran zindaron ; attributes: Vorondo voronwe , alcar Orom\u00e8o ; products originating from the head: y\u00e1ve m\u00f3no , \u00f3ma t\u00e1rio . Generally these categories are expressed with genitive partitive , while the rest \u2014 alienable relations \u2014 with genitive adjective : Vardava tellumar , r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e9va . Genitive of origin marks the location where the modifier originated from, or its creator (who might not be in its possession), or its author: location: Calaciryo m\u00edri , Eldar Malariando ; creator: r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e8o , i\u00b7coimas Eldaron . Genitive of origin is expressed with genitive partitive , but its locational function is complementary to ablative , particularly if the noun phrase already has a modifier in genitive of another function: menelluin \u00cdrildeo Ondolindello . Genitive of composition describes the relation between two nouns as a part to its whole: material or substance: yuldar miruv\u00f3reo ; content: parma mittarion , aure veryanwesto ; individual elements: y\u00e9nion y\u00e9ni ; source: astali hruo . Genitive of subject , marked by genitive I, denotes the subject of a verbal noun: T\u00faro matie masta , nero carie cirya . Note that the action can sometimes be implicit: R\u00e1no tie path of the Moon ('path taken by the Moon'). Genitive of object (genitive II) describes the affected patient of the action: Nurtale Valin\u00f3reva , ciryava carie . Note that gerund can take a direct specific object in accusative like a verb. In that case, the object must follow 2 it: carie cirya making of a (specific) ship . Determiner Genitive and Descriptive Genitive While the functions listed above are useful, in practice they don't cover a multitude of border cases which we label here as descriptive . Most grammars treat it as a homogenous category with only vaguely defined function, but we can distinguish a few categories within it, responsible for naming , comparing and describing : Classifying genitives are used to name certain objects, where the dependent clearly restricts the denotation of the head noun: Nand' Gondoluncava , hwesta zindarinwa , Eruva lisse . Such genitive is semantically most closely related to adjectives and loose compounds: farea nasto , meneldea Eru , Ambarmetta , Elennan\u00f3re . Therefore it typically employs genitive II 3 . Metaphorical Genitive is used to describe an object, experience, state etc. in terms of another one: y\u00e9ni \u00fan\u00f3tim\u00eb ve r\u00e1mar aldaron . Structurally these genitives behave like determiner genitives from before, but the dependent is very clearly not specific. They do not have the function of a typical determiner (i.e. the referential anchoring of a referent), but rather, they evoke a certain typical property . In contrast to metaphorical genitives, generic genitives are not used to compare a referent in terms of another referent (or the referent\u2019s properties) but to describe a specific referent by setting it in relation to its kind : lambe Eldaron . Genitive II and Loose Compound Tip Essentially, adjective genitive only differs from N + N sequences in containing the marker -va . There are two main factors determining the presence or absence of -va in N + N sequences (given that both allow for a possessive construal), i.e. the animacy and the referentiality of the dependent. Adjective genitive still contains some degree of referentiality, in any case more than in expressions with loose compounding. For this reason, r\u00e1cina [arquenwa macil] is more likely to refer to a specific knight than r\u00e1cina [arquen macil] . Furthermore, animate dependents are usually realized with the -va , while inanimate dependents prefer the loose construction. In many cases. however, animacy does not determine categorically whether a genitive or an N + N sequence is used, but rather the statistical preference (i.e. frequency) of the two constructions. Genitive Gradience Gradience in grammar is usually characterized as the phenomenon of blurred boundaries between two categories. When it comes to genitive and the use of genitive I over genitive II, we distinguish two sources for gradience: gradience of the semantic features and gradience as a mismatch in the meaning\u2013form mapping. Gradience of the semantic features arises from natural ambiguity of some interpretations: Eldar Malariando the elves of (from) Beleriand [genitive of origin] and Eldar Malariand\u00e9va the Beleriand elves [classifying genitive] are for all purposes the same. The choice then comes as mostly esthetical, but some difference in meaning might still be implied: yuldar miruv\u00f3reo draughts (made) of mead [genitive of composition] and yuldar miruv\u00f3reva mead draughts, draughts sweet like mead [classifying or metaphorical genitive]. Mismatch mapping is a very late phenomenon when Quenya stopped being a colloquial language. It surfaced as a confusion between semantics of genitive I and II and consequent displacement of the latter. Tip As a rule of thumb if you are in an muddy case where it is difficult to decide between genitive I or II, consider whether a dependent is conveying a reference (genitive I) or describing a property (genitive II): octe porceo an egg of (a specific) chicken ; octe porceva a chicken egg (and not a duck egg) . As Obligatory Constituent With Adjectives The following adjectives (often related in meaning to the verbs regularly taking adverbial modifiers, especially with partitive sense) are complemented by a genitive: 'filled with', 'released from', 'free from', etc. The genitive of comparison is used to complement comparatives: arimelda na ilyaron [PE17/57]. She is dearest of all . For more details on comparatives and their constructions, \u2192 32 . With Numerals From nelde three onwards, a preceding noun or noun phrase stand in genitive I plural: elenion nelde three stars . Note that in the late use it was substituted with accusative: eleni nelde three stars . For details on agreement of numerals, \u219226.TBD. As Predicative Complement or Prepositional Complement Many of the attributive uses of the genitive (\u219230.above) also occur as predicative complement with linking verbs. The genitive of quality , used to express a certain characteristic or manner of being, occurs exclusively in this way: neri \u00fa nati nostal\u00e8o mare [translated; PE15/32] 4 . Men are not beings good by nature . Similarly, attributive uses of the genitive may occur after certain prepositions (\u219231.8): Aina Wende mi Wenderon [VT44/12]. Holy Virgin of virgins . As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Sometimes verbs take genitive I in its partitive function to underline separation : verbs meaning 'remove from', 'rob of', 'free from' etc.: Varda ortane m\u00e1ryat Oiolosseo , lunces macilya vaileo 5 ; many verbs expressing sensorial or mental processes, to denote a source of stimulus: hlassenye\u00b7s Vardo 6 . Note To describe the direction , genitive is substituted with ablative : tentane Melcorello . Some verbs permit the genitive of cause to express the origin or reason for that action: s\u00edla R\u00e1no 7 . Dative The main function of the dative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers. It is also used to mark some required complements with verbs. Figure 30.1: Implication map: dative case of Quenya recipient : \u00e1men anta s\u00edra ilaurea massamma [VT43/12]. Give us this day our daily bread . benefactor : s\u00ed man i yulma nin enquantuva? [LotR/377]. Who now shall refill the cup for me? predicative possessor : umbe nin i hr\u00edve nauva urra [PE22/168]. I have a feeling that winter will be bad . experiencer : ece nin care sa [VT49/20]. Ece nin care sa . evaluator : i jarma \u00fa ten ulca s\u00edmaryassen [VT49/8]. The left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations . direction : mi cemen raine i h\u00ednin [VT44/34]. On earth peace, good will toward men . purpose : vanda sina termaruva Elenna\u00b7n\u00f3reo alcar enyalien [UT/305]. This oath shall stand in memory of the glory of the Land of the Star . As Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs) As Indirect Object The dative is used to express the indirect object or the recipient (Y) with the following types of verbs (X indicates a direct object in the common-accusative, where present): verbs meaning give , entrust , etc.; verbs meaning say , tell , report , etc. (usually with direct or indirect statement, \u219241.3); most verbs meaning command, order, advise etc. (usually together with an infinitive, \u219251.8); most verbs meaning seem , appear , etc. The dative as indirect object, or experiencer , complements the following impersonal verbs (\u219236.4-5), usually together with an infinitive (\u219251.8) (Y marks the dative): ece it is possible for Y (to do something); ola Y dreams (of something); h\u00b7ore Y feels an urge (to do something); moa 8 Y must (do something); nai it may chance for Y (to do something); Dative of the Possessor The dative of the possessor is used to complement 'existential' n\u00e1 and ea ( there is , \u219226.10), denoting possession, belonging, or interest. On the difference between this dative and verbs of possession ( same , harya , etc.), \u2192 TBD. As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Referring to Things or Abstract Entities The dative is very frequently used to express optional adverbial modifiers (\u219226.14). It marks nouns referring to things or abstract entities in various kinds of adverbial modifiers. The dative of cause expresses reason or cause. The bare dative of place may be used to express the direction whereto action takes place, as a short form of allative: lendes pallan i s\u00edr [PE17/65]. He came to a point far beyond the river . Referring to Persons The dative of advantage and dative of disadvantage are used to indicate the beneficiary (or opposite) of an action; they express in or against whose interest an action is performed: Ilu Il\u00favatar en c\u00e1re eldain a f\u00edrimoin [MQ: LR/63]. The Father made the World for Elves and Mortals . The dative also marks the person from whose perspective or vantage point the action is perceived: tulil m\u00e1rie nin [PE22/158]. You come happily for me . Instrumental The main function of the instrumental is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers. Figure 30.2: Implication map: instrumental case of Quenya 9 instrumental : antanenyes parmanen [PE17/91]. I presented him with a book . material : erulissenen quanta [VT43/26]. Filled with grace . manner : norne lintieryanen [PE17/58-59]. He ran as swiftly as he could . passive : tur\u00fan' ambartanen [UT/138]. By doom mastered . cause : Eru-indonen [PE22/165]. By the will of God . locative : tintilar i eleni l\u00edrinen [LotR/377]. The stars tremble in her voice . As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Instrumental case, as the name implies, most commonly marks the instrument or means by which an action is carried out: built with a hammer , painted with a brush , fought with fists . The instrumental of material is closely adjacent to it, and is used to complement transitive verbs and related adjectives to describe the material used in action: built with stone , rich with spoils , fraught with sorrows . Note the difference: filled with water (instrumental of material), but full of water (genitive of material). The instrumental of manner describes the manner in which an action was carried out, particularly with abstract nouns: carry with weariness , shine with golden light , give in measure 10 . The instrumental of agent is used in passive constructions to denote the agent of the action: executed by the king , heard by the audience , blamed by the wicked . While the instrumental of agent is usually employed for voluntary actions of animate nouns, similar instrumental of cause describes the circumstances in which an action happened, sometimes tangentially, and generally can be substituted in gloss with because of : disabled by a wound , bent with the sails 11 . The instrumental of location describes location or other intrinsic relations linked to the manner or source of an action, typically of intransitive verbs, and is generally translated with in, on : fall in the wind , cloack in veils , fluttering on the wings . Locative The main function of the locative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the scene of the action, generally pointing out where or when the action is happening. Spatial Locative The locative describes a general spatial relation. We can postulate the basing meaning as 12 : Rule Rule : The figure is located close to the ground . The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use of specific spatial adpositions, like mi in or to on (\u2192 TBD), emphasizes the particulars of the relation and can highlight any deviations from the default assumption, thus serving to cancel unwarranted implicatures: Rules Implication : The figure is in contact with the ground. The figure\u2013ground relation is canonical . The ground supports the figure against gravity . The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically: a plate is on a table rather than under it, while an apple is in a bowl rather than at it. To provide some examples: the locative conveys the notion of being within a containment: i fairi n\u00e9ce ringa s\u00famaryasse ve maiwi yaimie [MC/222]. The pale phantoms in her cold bosom like gulls wailing . it denotes a surface, trodden or touched: man tiruva r\u00e1cina cirya gondolisse morne? [MC/222]. Who shall heed a broken ship on the dark rocks? it signifies the dominion or territory: Altariello nainie L\u00f3riendesse [RGEO/58]. Galadriel\u2019s lament in L\u00f3rien . and the substance the locus is submerged into: nicsi coitar nenesse [PE22/125]. Fish live in water . Locative of Circumstance As the extenstion of this meaning, the locative often denotes the circumstances , under which the action comes to pass. This kind of locative encompasses the locative of time as well as the absolute locative (TBD). Locative of Time The locative of time refers to a specific moment or period: at which the event happens; by which the event should happen. qe e\u00b7k\u00e1rie i kirya aldaryas, ni kauva kiryasta menelyas [MQ: PE22/121]. If he finishes the boat by Tuesday , I shall be able to sail on Wednesday . Locative of Respect The locative of respect may denote the particular point of view from which a statement is made. This occurs chiefly with adjectives but also with intransitive verbs, and in gloss can be substituted with with regard to : i jarma \u00fa ten ulca s\u00edmaryassen [VT49/6]. the left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations . Such locative can be used for: parts of the body: pain in finger, blind in mind, smitten on the neck ; qualities and attributes (nature, form, size, name, birth, number, etc.): rival in appearance, two leagues in width ; sphere in general: terrible in battle, good in matters in which he is skilled . The instrumental of manner and genitive of quality are often nearly equivalent to the locative of respect: men are good in nature; men are good by nature; men are of good nature 13 . Locative of Manner With abstract nouns locative of manner can be used periphrasically to describe the state: hara m\u00e1riesse [PE17/162]. Stay in happiness (or: stay happily ) alalye nattira arcandemmar sangiessemman [VT44/8]. Despise not our petitions in our necessities (or: done out of necessity ). As Obligatory Complement Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in locative case: Heru \u00f3rava omesse [VT44/12]. Lord, have mercy on us . Allative The main function of the allative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the goal of the motion, generally pointing out whither . Figure 30.3: Implication map: allative case of Quenya As a Direction of Movement The allative describes a general directional goal of the movement. The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use with a specific spatial static adposition, like nu under (\u2192 TBD), emphasizes the particulars: lantaner Turcildi nuhuinenna [LR/47]. the Lordly Men fell under shadow . enwina l\u00fame elenillor pella talta-taltala [MC/222]. The old darkness beyond the stars falling . The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically, and a series of directional adpositions are used instead when the context is not complicit: unlunke naiqe yu vaile\u00b7na ar elle ha men ambostuva [EQ: PE16/146]. He pulled his sword from the sheath and drove it into the breast . To provide some canonic examples: the allative describes the motion into a containment : eari ullier i kilyanna [LR/47]. The seas poured into the chasm . it denotes a surface a movement is directed towards and comes into direct contact with: Anar caluva tielyanna [UT/22]. The sun shall shine upon your path . it signifies entered dominion or territory : Et E\u00e4rello Endorenna ut\u00falien [LotR/967]. Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth have I come . and generally the end point of a movement or intended destination : hr\u00edve \u00fava v\u00e9na [PE22/167]. Winter is drawing near to us . quiquie menin coaryanna, arse [VT49/24]. Whenever I arrive at his house, he is out . as well as the target of aim : ar c\u00e9 mo formenna tentanes Amanna [VT49/8]. And if (one turned face) northwards, it (left hand) pointed towards Aman . Warning Allative profiles the goal as the intended destination , but it does not specify whether this goal is reached or whether an agent is somewhere on the way. However, if the direction is not the goal, the allative cannot be used. To describe the directionality of the path, the adposition na towards is employed instead 14 . Allative of Time In the domain of time, the use of the allative is restricted to those expressions where both the starting point and the endpoint are mentioned. For instance, if we want to say 'from Monday to Friday', we will use the allative as in izilyallo valanyanna , but if we just want to mention the endpoint, the use of the allative is not allowed; instead, the adposition tenna until is used. Therefore, until tomorrow is translated as tenna enar 16 . Allative of Purpose Assumption Extending the meaning of direction, allative also signifies the purpose of the action, following a frequent conceptualization: causes are origins of events , and purposes are destinations : let's go looking for food 15 . For the use of allative of purpose in periphrasic future construction \u2192 TBD. Allative as Translative Assumption Verbs of change like \u00f3la , virya , ahya take allative to describe a final state or result : he turned into a great scholar . Allative of Extent Similar to instrumental, allative can describe how an action was carried out, answering a question to what extent? to what degree? a laita t\u00e1rienna [LotR/953]. Praise (them) to the height . As Obligatory Complement As Direct Object Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in allative case: verya senna [VT49/45]. I married her . Tar-Calion octac\u00e1re Valannar [LR/47]. Tar-Kalion warred the Powers . As Indirect Object Generally, dative denoting a recipient can be freely substituted for allative: antane ninna [PE17/147]. He gave it to me . sin quent\u00eb Quendingoldo Elendilenna [PM/401]. Thus Pengolodh said to Elendil . Ablative The main function of the ablative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the source of the motion, generally pointing out whence , and is therefore the very opposite of allative . As a Direction of Movement The ablative, then, is wanted to express from what place there is a starting and moving: in its proper sense, movement away from : m\u00e9tima hrestallo c\u00edra leave the last shore [MC/221]; movement out of a container, often accompanied with a preposition et : Melko Mardello lende Melko has gone from Earth [MQ: LR/72] et E\u00e4rello Endorenna ut\u00falien out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I have come [LotR/967]; starting point of movement: elenillor pella talta-taltala beyond stars falling [MC/222] pointing, aiming away from: i hyarma tentane Melkorello the left hand pointed away from Melkor [VT49/6]; Assumption moving off a surface; to see, hear, speak etc from a spot; Warning Verbs of separation from the whole take genitive I: n\u00b7alalmino hy\u00e1 lanta lasse from the elm-tree here a leaf falls [EQ:VT40/8]. Ablative of Source, Origin and Cause In a more abstract sense with verbs of: taking, receiving from : yello camnelyes from whom you received him [VT47/21]; protecting, guarding, securing from : \u00e1me etelehta ulcullo deliver us from evil [VT43/12]; being afraid of [VT44/7]; Assumption asking, wishing, learning from ; restraining, preventing, excluding from ; Note Ablative of origin can also be used as an attributive modifier: Menelluin \u00cdrildeo Gondolindello Cornflower of Idril from Gondolin [TAI/193], fanwen tollillon l\u00f3mealloi a dream from the gloomy islands [PE16/147]. Genitive I is more common in this role, however. Assumption From a common interpretation causes are origins of events arises the ablative of cause, describing the cause, reason, motive by which an action or an event came to be 17 . Ablative of Time When denoting time, the ablative carries the meaning of from, since, after . Commonly it is attended by prepositions, as et : et sillumello ter y\u00e9nion y\u00e9ni tenn' ambarmetta from this hour, through years of years until the ending of the world [VT44/33], but it is possible to go with single ablative 18 . Ablative as Exessive Assumption As the opposite of translative, exessive denotes the former state or shape , out of which some other state or shape proceeds or is produced. As Obligatory Complement As Indirect Object A few special verbs take second (indirect) object in ablative: \u00e1vatyara mello roctammar [VT43/11]. Forgive us our trespasses .

Quenya distinguishes two genitival cases: genitive I or partitive and genitive II or adjective 1 .","title":"Genitive"},{"location":"syntx/cas/#as-modifier-in-a-noun-phrase-the-attributive-genitive","text":"The genitive is used particularly within noun phrases, to mark a noun phrase or pronoun as modifier of a head (\u219226.18). Traditionally, many different categories within this attributive genitive use are distinguished; the most important of these are given below: The genitive of possession denotes ownership, belonging, etc.; The genitive of origin denotes the origin, offspring, source, etc. of the head; With nouns that express an action ('action nouns', \u219223.6), the genitive is used for the subject or object of that action \u2014 genitive of the subject (or 'subjective' genitive) or of the object (or 'objective' genitive); Other relations between nouns: material/contents, price/value, elaboration, etc. Genitive of possession distinguishes alienable (which can be given away or lost) and inalienable (perpetual and inherent to the head) possession. Concepts comprising inalienable possession include: body parts: r\u00e1mar aldaron , hon maro ; part-whole relations: tyulma ciryo , aicasse Taniquetildo ; kinship terms: amille Hristo , indis i\u00b7ciryamo ; various social relations: ingwe ingweron , aran zindaron ; attributes: Vorondo voronwe , alcar Orom\u00e8o ; products originating from the head: y\u00e1ve m\u00f3no , \u00f3ma t\u00e1rio . Generally these categories are expressed with genitive partitive , while the rest \u2014 alienable relations \u2014 with genitive adjective : Vardava tellumar , r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e9va . Genitive of origin marks the location where the modifier originated from, or its creator (who might not be in its possession), or its author: location: Calaciryo m\u00edri , Eldar Malariando ; creator: r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e8o , i\u00b7coimas Eldaron .

Genitive of subject , marked by genitive I, denotes the subject of a verbal noun: T\u00faro matie masta , nero carie cirya . Note that the action can sometimes be implicit: R\u00e1no tie path of the Moon ('path taken by the Moon'). Genitive of object (genitive II) describes the affected patient of the action: Nurtale Valin\u00f3reva , ciryava carie . Note that gerund can take a direct specific object in accusative like a verb.

Most grammars treat it as a homogenous category with only vaguely defined function, but we can distinguish a few categories within it, responsible for naming , comparing and describing : Classifying genitives are used to name certain objects, where the dependent clearly restricts the denotation of the head noun: Nand' Gondoluncava , hwesta zindarinwa , Eruva lisse . Such genitive is semantically most closely related to adjectives and loose compounds: farea nasto , meneldea Eru , Ambarmetta , Elennan\u00f3re . Therefore it typically employs genitive II 3 . Metaphorical Genitive is used to describe an object, experience, state etc. in terms of another one: y\u00e9ni \u00fan\u00f3tim\u00eb ve r\u00e1mar aldaron . Structurally these genitives behave like determiner genitives from before, but the dependent is very clearly not specific. They do not have the function of a typical determiner (i.e. the referential anchoring of a referent), but rather, they evoke a certain typical property . In contrast to metaphorical genitives, generic genitives are not used to compare a referent in terms of another referent (or the referent\u2019s properties) but to describe a specific referent by setting it in relation to its kind : lambe Eldaron .","title":"Determiner Genitive and Descriptive Genitive"},{"location":"syntx/cas/#genitive-ii-and-loose-compound","text":"Tip Essentially, adjective genitive only differs from N + N sequences in containing the marker -va . There are two main factors determining the presence or absence of -va in N + N sequences (given that both allow for a possessive construal), i.e. the animacy and the referentiality of the dependent. Adjective genitive still contains some degree of referentiality, in any case more than in expressions with loose compounding. For this reason, r\u00e1cina [arquenwa macil] is more likely to refer to a specific knight than r\u00e1cina [arquen macil] . Furthermore, animate dependents are usually realized with the -va , while inanimate dependents prefer the loose construction. In many cases. however, animacy does not determine categorically whether a genitive or an N + N sequence is used, but rather the statistical preference (i.e. frequency) of the two constructions.","title":"Genitive II and Loose Compound"},{"location":"syntx/cas/#genitive-gradience","text":"Gradience in grammar is usually characterized as the phenomenon of blurred boundaries between two categories. When it comes to genitive and the use of genitive I over genitive II, we distinguish two sources for gradience: gradience of the semantic features and gradience as a mismatch in the meaning\u2013form mapping. Gradience of the semantic features arises from natural ambiguity of some interpretations: Eldar Malariando the elves of (from) Beleriand [genitive of origin] and Eldar Malariand\u00e9va the Beleriand elves [classifying genitive] are for all purposes the same. The choice then comes as mostly esthetical, but some difference in meaning might still be implied: yuldar miruv\u00f3reo draughts (made) of mead [genitive of composition] and yuldar miruv\u00f3reva mead draughts, draughts sweet like mead [classifying or metaphorical genitive]. Mismatch mapping is a very late phenomenon when Quenya stopped being a colloquial language. It surfaced as a confusion between semantics of genitive I and II and consequent displacement of the latter. Tip As a rule of thumb if you are in an muddy case where it is difficult to decide between genitive I or II, consider whether a dependent is conveying a reference (genitive I) or describing a property (genitive II): octe porceo an egg of (a specific) chicken ; octe porceva a chicken egg (and not a duck egg) .","title":"Genitive Gradience"},{"location":"syntx/cas/#as-obligatory-constituent","text":"","title":"As Obligatory Constituent"},{"location":"syntx/cas/#with-adjectives","text":"The following adjectives (often related in meaning to the verbs regularly taking adverbial modifiers, especially with partitive sense) are complemented by a genitive: 'filled with', 'released from', 'free from', etc. The genitive of comparison is used to complement comparatives: arimelda na ilyaron [PE17/57].

The material from Early Quenya has been temporarily adopted. This chapter deals with a number of expressions that are syntactically quite diverse, but have in common one of the two following properties: either entities are compared with respect to a property they possess, or properties of an entity are compared. A typical comparative construction consists of five constituent parts: [ My sister ] 1 is [ as ] 2 [ pretty ] 3 [ as ] 4 [ you ] 5 . comparee parameter marker parameter standard marker standard The parameter , the standard (adjective, in the most basic case), and the comparee are open class elements. The parameter marker and the standard marker are functional and fairly fixed. Depending on which constituents are expressed and how, the following types of comparison are distinguished: expressions in which entities are compared with respect to a certain quality, i.e. comparative of inequality : superiority, inferiority or equative; expressions in which qualities (usually of the same entity) are compared in their extent; expressions in which the (dis)similarity between terms is expressed lexically ; expressions that characterize the manner in which a certain event takes place or the quality of a certain entity; relative adjectives of amount. This type is discussed in @@; finally, proportional and superlative constructions. Elative and Attenuative Quenya doesn't have comparative or superlative forms of adjectives so typical to European languages. Mostly it uses neutral or unmarked positive adjectives in comparison constructions, but sometimes we find adjectives with intensity markers: elatives and attenuatives. A special form of adjective, called elative , expresses a relatively high degree of the meaning of an adjective, or a higher degree than expected in the specific situation or in general: Arwen anamelda Arwen is very beautiful . elen ancalima very bright star, star brighter than usual . The elative is formed either with a prefix ama- or with ari- , the latter expressing much higher contrast between concepts, persons, entities or groups 1 . Finally, a prefix ere- indicates the uniqueness of the high degree of intensity: elen ancalima very bright star ; elen arcalima extremely bright star . elen ercalima sole bright star, one of a kind bright star . Early Material The opposite of elative, attenuative , expresses a lower degree of quality: niccezyaima not particularly interesting . Adjectives which have a clear antonym ( good \u2014 bad , big \u2014 small ) rarely use such form. Together elative and attenuative are called graded adjectives . To form them, beside the prefixes mentioned above, positive adjective can also take augmentative and diminutive nominal suffixes: luininc\u00eb bluish . Comparison between two terms with respect to a certain quality Quenya has two types of devices for comparing two terms with respect to a certain quality: devices that express the equivalence (or: equality) of such terms; and devices that express the non-equivalence (or: inequality). Comparison of non-equivalence In the case of non-equivalence the comparative formula lacks a parameter marker. The combination of parameter and standard marker can be divided into three classes: Positive adjectives, sometimes modified by an adverb with a comparative meaning like ambe more and nince less , with a standard marker l\u00e1 than ; similarly adverbs modified by a comparative adverb; Elative forms related to adverbs/prepositions with a local or temporal meaning like amna closer, nearer ; Lexical items with a comparative meaning, including: positive or graded adjectives with adverbs and prepositions that indicate relative position (in space or time) like epe before , n\u00f3 after , imb\u00eb among , and ar beyond ; verbs expressing preference, such as to prefer or to be preferable . A negated expression of non-equivalence sometimes comes close to an expression of equivalence. This is especially the case with \u00fa nence l\u00e1 no less than and \u00fa ambe l\u00e1 no more than . The comparative particle l\u00e1 'than' The regular comparative expression of non-equivalence consists of a positive adjective combined with l\u00e1 for introducing the standard of comparison. There are almost no syntactic or semantic restrictions on the use of this particle, as opposed to the use of epe / n\u00f3 and the genitive or dative of comparison. Earendil calima l\u00e1 Luinil [modified; PE17/90]. Venus is brighter than Rigel . Assumption In this way superiority was inferred. For better clarity the adjective may be modified by an expression of degree ambe more and nence less . The spatial prepositions as standard markers Prepositions epe and n\u00f3 4 in conjunction with positive or graded adjectives are another typical way to form explicitly marked comparative of superiority and inferiority: Earendil (an)calima epe Luinil [modified; PE17/57]. Venus is brighter than Rigel ; Luinil (nic)calima n\u00f3 Earendel Rigel is less bright than Venus . Early Material No example of attenuative in later phases has been published yet, but there is a document where they might be mentioned 2 . It is not clear whether positive adjectives would be permitted with these markers, but they might well be 3 . Other spatial prepositions also occur in this role: ancalima imbi eleni [PE17/91]. Brightest among stars ; anamelda ar ilyan [PE17/57]. Dearest of all . Note the use of dative with the preposition ar . The dative of comparison With set expressions, especially of proverbial notion, or in poetry an older dative of comparison (30.@@) can be found: malda muntar [EQ: PE14/81]. Better than nothing . The comparative element used with expressions of quantity, extent of space or time, age, etc. Assumption With the comparatives ambe more , amne nearer , ambela farther , amanda longer , any\u00e1ra older etc, used in combination with an expression of quantity or of extent of space or distance l\u00e1 is not used. Expressions specifying the measure of difference in comparisons of non-equivalence To-Do accusative ('an inch taller than'); l\u00e9 ('taller than ... by an inch'); similarly, instrumental. Comparison of equivalence The most common way to indicate that two terms are equivalent with respect to a certain parameter is with the correlative adverbs ta ... ve . These adverbs can be used with adjectives, adverbs, prepositional phrases, and with verbs, but also with entire clauses. The parameter may be indicated with both terms but is usually indicated only with one. An example of indication of the parmeter in both terms is ( @@ ). For other correlative pairs, \u2192 32.@@ . Equivalence can also be expressed by other combinations of correlative words, as in si ... ve or yalle . Negation of an expression of comparison of equivalence can be interpreted more or less as an expression of non-equivalence, as in @@, where \u00fa ta ... ve resembles nince ... l\u00e1 . Similative While comparison of equivalence (or equative ) expresses degree and extent, or in other words, quantity , a similar but syntactically different construction similative compares terms in their manner : i\u00b7fairi ve maiwi yaimie [MC/222]. The phantoms like gulls wailing . It mostly employs a bare conjunction ve like , but we also find more emphatic tambe or s\u00edve just as or, between clauses, relative-based yalle : na car\u00eb ind\u00f3melya cemende tambe Erumande [VT43/17]. Thy will be done on Earth as in Heaven . A carne ta yalle B (carne) [PE17/74]. A did like/as B (did) . Comparison between two properties As with comparison between two terms, for comparison between two 'properties' a distinction must be made between the situation in which two properties are presented as equivalent and one in which they are presented as nonequivalent. Comparison of non-equivalence between two properties For indicating that of two properties which an entity possesses one is present in a higher (or lower) degree than the other, Quenya employs ambe (or nince ) l\u00e1 . It can be used to compare two verbs, both expressed but with a different degree. In a similar way it is used to compare two adjectives (with the copula expressed or not), but it can also be used to compare two adverbs (with the adverbs functioning as disjuncts). Note In a way resembling the corrective use of ambe mentioned above, ecse ... l\u00e1 rather than , and to a lesser extent rongo ... l\u00e1 sooner than , can be used to correct a term or to replace it by another term. These expressions convey a subjective evaluation. Comparison of equivalence between two properties Properties that are presented as equivalent may have various forms and may occur at various levels. Typically they can be analyzed as two equative clauses, coordinated with yalle . A tulca yalle n\u00f3rima A is as strong as he is fast ; Similarity and dissimilarity Expressions of similarity and dissimilarity belong to various lexical classes: imya the same , enta other , and related adverbs; ov\u00e8a similar , v\u00e9la alike , etc.; To-Do Coin such words as equal, different, otherwise , etc. Coordinators? Adverbs of manner? Proportional Comparison To-Do ve ... ta/si ? The superlative and related expressions While the comparative expresses the higher degree of the meaning of an adjective with respect to some reference , the superlative expresses the highest degree . The comparative is employed to compare two entities or two groups of entities, while the superlative typically oposes one entity to a group. The superlative in Quenya is usually expressed in one of three ways: an article with partitive 3 : i rind\u00eb roccoron the fastest of horses ; a graded adjective with partitive: ancalima elenion [PE17/56]. One of the brightest stars ; arcalima elenion [PE17/56]. The brightest of stars . a positive or graded adjective with prepositions imbe or ar , especially with universal quantifiers ilya or illi : (an)calima imbi eleni [PE17/91]. Brightest among stars ; (ana)melda ar ilyan [PE17/57]. Dearest of all .

The material from Early Quenya has been temporarily adopted. This chapter deals with a number of expressions that are syntactically quite diverse, but have in common one of the two following properties: either entities are compared with respect to a property they possess, or properties of an entity are compared. A typical comparative construction consists of five constituent parts: [ My sister ] 1 is [ as ] 2 [ pretty ] 3 [ as ] 4 [ you ] 5 . comparee parameter marker parameter standard marker standard The parameter , the standard (adjective, in the most basic case), and the comparee are open class elements. The parameter marker and the standard marker are functional and fairly fixed. Depending on which constituents are expressed and how, the following types of comparison are distinguished: expressions in which entities are compared with respect to a certain quality, i.e. comparative of inequality : superiority, inferiority or equative; expressions in which qualities (usually of the same entity) are compared in their extent; expressions in which the (dis)similarity between terms is expressed lexically ; expressions that characterize the manner in which a certain event takes place or the quality of a certain entity; relative adjectives of amount.

The elative is formed either with a prefix ama- or with ari- , the latter expressing much higher contrast between concepts, persons, entities or groups 1 . Finally, a prefix ere- indicates the uniqueness of the high degree of intensity: elen ancalima very bright star ; elen arcalima extremely bright star . elen ercalima sole bright star, one of a kind bright star .

Adjectives which have a clear antonym ( good \u2014 bad , big \u2014 small ) rarely use such form. Together elative and attenuative are called graded adjectives .

A significant overhaul of the chapter should be expected. Pronouns and Quantifiers Personal Pronouns Accented and Non-Accented Personal Pronouns Personal pronouns are used only pronominally (\u219226.22-3). They are either accented ( stressed and emphatic ) or non-accented (for details, \u21927.1-2): to an extent, this distinction corresponds to a contrastive and a non-contrastive function. When describing the subject, and no (contrastive) emphasis is needed, the personal endings of the verb suffice. The unaccented pronouns are then only used in oblique cases . c\u00e9 tulis, tanome nauvan [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . No emphasis on the subject. nai lye hiruva airea Amanar [AUCT-LET/1963-12-18]. May thee find a blessed Yule . Unaccented pronoun in oblique case. Contrast signals to a listener that the utterance should be taken as one of several alternatives. Depending on their importance, contrast might be exhaustive or uncertain . Exhaustive is contrast where all relevant alternatives are covered, either explicitly in several clauses, or implicitly with entity present in the context: inye t\u00fale, apa isse \u00fane [\u2014]. I came, but HE didn\u2019t . All other alternatives (e.g. me not coming, or him coming) are explicitly dismissed. nai elye hiruva [LotR/378]. Maybe THOU shalt find it . Galadriel implicitly contrasts herself to Frodo, expecting never to come back to Valimar herself. Alternatives of exhaustive contrast are generally mutually exclusive. With an uncertain contrast the speaker is only making a claim about the referent of the pronoun and leaves it open whether this claim should or should not apply to the other referents relevant in the discourse: c\u00e9 tulis, n\u00ed nauva tanome [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . Whether anyone else will be there is left on the table. Unlike alternatives of exhaustive contrast, here they don\u2019t need to be exclusive. Another factor is focality . Some of the typical cases include clefts, answers to wh-questions, comparative constructions, focus constructions, etc: melinye s\u00e9 apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love HIM , but not HIM . The answer to a question: ' Whom do you love?' Main purpose of an accented pronoun in such position is to identify a referent as one of several alternatives, or to exhaust the set by dismissing all other alternatives: aistana elye im\u00edca n\u00edsi [VT43/28]. Blessed art THOU amongst women . Exhaustive pronoun implies that only Mary is considered. Tip The difference between stressed and emphatic pronouns then comes to differentiate between these two classes of contrast. Exhaustive contrast is denoted by emphatic pronouns, often appended in translation to English with only or even . Stressed pronouns are used then for weak, identifying contrast. However, this distinction does not always hold. First and Second Person First-person pronoun refers to a speaker, and in addition to number and accent distinguishes clusivity: listener can be either involved ( inclusive 'we') or specifically excepted ( exclusive 'we') from the context. unaccented stressed emphatic sg. ni n\u00ed inye pl. incl. we w\u00e9 elwe pl. excl. me m\u00e9 elme d. incl. wet w\u00e9t inque d. excl. met m\u00e9t emme Second-person pronoun refers to a listener, and has different levels of formality: unaccented stressed emphatic sg. familiar tye ty\u00e9 itye sg. formal lye ly\u00e9 elye pl. le l\u00e9 elde d. lyet ly\u00e9t este Note In colloquial speech, particularly of Men, plural exclusive form was sometimes used for first person plural in general. This was considered incorrect by Ngoldor 1 . Later, except for colloquial speech, familiar tye was eventually displaced by lye . To denote respect tar sir, madam could be used instead 2 . To-Do Add -tar inflection. Third and Fourth Person Third- and fourth-person pronouns refer to an entity other than a speaker or a listener. To alleviate the ambiguity between several actors within the same phrase, first actor is marked as third-person, and the following as fourth: s\u00e9 ringane h\u00e9, ar h\u00e9 runce [modified VT49/15]. He struck him , and he fled . There is no ambiguity, as there would be in English. Third and fourth person distinguish animate and inanimate gender. Distinction is semantic: animates are noun capable to act on their own volition (including trees and plants), and inanimates are the rest (including abstract concepts). third-person pronouns: unaccented stressed emphatic sg. anim. se s\u00e9 isse pl. anim. te t\u00e9 inte sg. inanim. sa s\u00e1 issa pl. inanim. ta(i) t\u00e1 inta d. tu t\u00fa itte fourth-person pronouns (only singular): unaccented stressed emphatic sg. anim. je j\u00e9 ecse sg. inanim. ja j\u00e1 ecsa Reflexive Pronouns and Other Reflexive Expressions Introduction; Pronouns Used as Reflexives; Direct and Indirect Reflexives Reflexivity is the phenomenon whereby a pronoun is used to 'reflect' (i.e. refer back or forwards to) another constituent of the sentence or clause, nearly always the subject: an c\u00e9 mo querne immo n\u00famenna [draft VT49/6]. For if one turned oneself westward . A distinction is made between: direct reflexivity : pronouns which refer back to an element within the same clause/construction; indirect reflexivity : pronouns in a subordinate construction (subordinate clauses, infinitive or participle constructions), which refer back to an element in the main/matrix clause (for subordination, \u219239.2, 39.5): Elerondo quente insen Elrond said to himself . Direct reflexive: inse is the indirect object of quente , and refers to its subject. Elerondo hlasse sa Elessar quente sen Elrond heard what Aragorn told him . Indirect reflexive: sen refers back to the subject of hlasse , but syntactically is a part of the dependent clause. Tip Like English, Quenya doesn't use reflexive pronouns with introverted actions unlike many other languages, preferring bare intransitive verbs. Typical extroverted verbs are transitive verbs like 'kill', 'hate', 'criticize', 'see', 'attack', and typical introverted verbs are verbs like 'wash', 'shave', 'dress', 'defend'. Some introverted actions might be expressed by the mediopassive voice, but only with certain verbs ('verbs of grooming', \u219235.11). Extroverted actions always require a pronoun. The following pronouns are used in reflexive constructions: the reflexive pronoun ( imne , imule , inse , etc., \u21927.3); (oblique cases of) the personal pronoun ( ni , lye, se`, etc., \u21927.2); reflexive inflection. Note A distinction should thus be maintained between 'reflexive pronouns' (a morphological category, referring to a specific type of pronoun, inse , etc.) and 'pronouns used in reflexive constructions' (a syntactic phenomenon). While reflexive pronouns always express reflexivity, reflexivity is not always necessarily marked by the use of a reflexive pronoun. To-Do Go through PE22/94 in case there are some missed details. Pronouns Used as Direct and Indirect Reflexives Obviation In many (or perhaps most) languages, nonsubject anaphoric personal pronouns are obviative , i.e. they cannot be coreferential with a coargument: The dogs 1 bit them 2/*1 . Quenya, however, has three types of third person anaphoric pronouns: an obviative nonreflexive pronoun je , a nonobviative nonreflexive pronun se , and a reflexive pronoun inse : 3 Zindacollo 1 tatalla je 2 / se 1/2 / inse 1 . Thingol admires him 2 / him(self) 1/2 / himself 1 . Note how the use of se can be ambiguous. Direct Reflexivity In the direct reflexive use, the reflexive pronoun is normally required, particularly for emphasis (\u219229.2-5) or to distinguish from reciprocal use of personal pronoun (\u219229.14). Arwen cenne inse i\u00b7cilintilasse Arwen saw herself in the mirror . However, personal pronouns can be used as direct reflexives, especially in the first and second person, and in poetry much more freely than in prose. ni\u00b7c\u00faven I hid myself . If the third person is implicit , verb receives a reflexive ending: melisse / melitte [VT49/21]. He loves himself / they love themselves . Indirect Reflexivity In indirect reflexive context, the nonobviative nonrelexive pronouns are used (reflexive pronoun is bound locally ): Arcimbelenna leltani\u00e9la h\u00b7oraneltet roccor t\u00e9na ta rimba ve c\u00e1rima tulta They 1 sent to Rivendell and asked that they 2 send them 1/3 as many horses as possible . t\u00e9na refers back to the subject of h\u00b7oraneltet (1), though obviative interpretation (3) is possible. inte could only refer to the subject of infinitive clause (2). Possessive Pronouns and Other Expressions of Possession Quenya uses the following pronominal constructions to express possession, belonging, descent, origin, etc.: possessive suffixes, \u21927.7; possessive pronouns ( ninya , lelya , s\u00e9va , etc., \u21927.8). Separate possessive pronouns may be used pronominally or adnominally. In the latter case, they are normally used for emphasis (\u219229.2-5), and in poetry much more freely than in prose: nan \u00faye s\u00e9re indo-ninya s\u00edmen, ullume [LR/72]. But my heart resteth not here for ever . \u00e1vatyara mello menye roctar [draft; VT43/11]. Forgive us our trespasses . Reciprocal Pronouns The reciprocal construction expresses the idea that two or more persons are simultaneously involved in one and the same action, like English each other , one another . Reciprocal actions can be expressed in Quenya by the preverb o\u00b7 with (e.g. o\u00b7mennente they met each other ), by the personal pronoun ( te palpanente they hit each other ) and by the repetition of cognates: m\u00e1 sove m\u00e1 Hands wash each other . Demonstrative Pronouns Pointing Outside or Inside the Text Demonstratives have a pointing or deictic function. They may either point to someone/thing in the world outside the text , or to a single word or larger segment of the text itself . Telperinquar Erciandello tence sine tenguar [translated; LotR/305]. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs . sine refers to the signs actually present on the door, \u2192 we might imagine Celebrimbor pointing at them. lende tanna Nieliccelis, sana wende nieninquea [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le, that maiden like a snowdrop . The pronoun refers to element in the text, anaphorically to Ni\u00e9le. When pointing outside of the text, demonstratives distinguish between proximal sina this by me , medial tana that by you , and distal enta yonder : sina refers to something immediately near to the speaker (physically or mentally); tana refers to something within the reach of the speaker and/or addressee (physically or mentally), but not specifically near to the speaker; enta refers to something beyond the reach of the speaker and addressee (physically or mentally). When a demonstrative refers to an element in the text itself it may refer backward to something introduced before (anaphoric use) or point forward in the text to something about to be introduced (cataphoric use): sina or enta normally serve to announce something that will follow immediately, or refer to something prominent in the speaker's mind; sana is used most often to refer to something mentioned previously; to refer to something which has not been mentioned for a while (or to pick up something which was mentioned before a form of sana or sina 'intervened') a form of yana former must be used instead. Further Particulars Forms of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs usually have short and long forms (\u21927.18). The long demonstrative nearly always carries heavier stress: sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambarmetta [LotR/967]. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world . umbe nin i hr\u00edve nauva urra si loa [PE22/168]. I have a feeling that winter will be bad this year . Sentential Pronouns While personal pronouns refer to specific words or noun phrases (or constructions operating as noun phrases), sometimes we might need to mention a larger segment of a conversation instead, a clause or a sequence of clauses. Alongside demonstrative pronouns, Quenya has two additional sentential pronouns for this case \u2014 subjective ha and objective sa (similar to sana , \u219229.14): y\u00e1ra T\u00faro mante ilqua masta, ha m\u00e9\u00b7ne \u00famactale [PE22/119]. Old Turo ate all the bread, that was a nuisance to us . Pronoun ha means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'. y\u00e1ra T\u00faro mante ilqua masta. M\u00e9\u00b7l\u00e1ner fasta sa [modified; PE22/119]. Old Turo ate all the bread. We were not pleased with that . Pronoun sa means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'. Indefinite Pronouns The indefinite pronouns refer to someone or something that is not immediately identifiable. They can appear in the varying contexts, some of which include: When the speaker does not wish to reveal , or pay attention to, the identity of a specific individual: n\u00e1mo tule, intya man Someone came, guess who . When referring to individuals whose specific identity is unknown or irrelevant : hlassen ma, mal \u00fa istan manima I heard something, but I don't know of what sort . When referring to something non-specific or non-existing : neve ma h\u00b7ecsa, mecin Please, try something else 4 . In comparison , condition and possibility : n\u00e1se halda l\u00e1 aiquen He is taller than anyone ; c\u00e9 cenil aiquen, quet\u00e1 nin Shall you see anyone, tell me ; lertal mique aiquen You may kiss anyone .

They are either accented ( stressed and emphatic ) or non-accented (for details, \u21927.1-2): to an extent, this distinction corresponds to a contrastive and a non-contrastive function. When describing the subject, and no (contrastive) emphasis is needed, the personal endings of the verb suffice. The unaccented pronouns are then only used in oblique cases . c\u00e9 tulis, tanome nauvan [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . No emphasis on the subject. nai lye hiruva airea Amanar [AUCT-LET/1963-12-18]. May thee find a blessed Yule . Unaccented pronoun in oblique case. Contrast signals to a listener that the utterance should be taken as one of several alternatives. Depending on their importance, contrast might be exhaustive or uncertain . Exhaustive is contrast where all relevant alternatives are covered, either explicitly in several clauses, or implicitly with entity present in the context: inye t\u00fale, apa isse \u00fane [\u2014]. I came, but HE didn\u2019t . All other alternatives (e.g. me not coming, or him coming) are explicitly dismissed. nai elye hiruva [LotR/378]. Maybe THOU shalt find it . Galadriel implicitly contrasts herself to Frodo, expecting never to come back to Valimar herself. Alternatives of exhaustive contrast are generally mutually exclusive. With an uncertain contrast the speaker is only making a claim about the referent of the pronoun and leaves it open whether this claim should or should not apply to the other referents relevant in the discourse: c\u00e9 tulis, n\u00ed nauva tanome [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . Whether anyone else will be there is left on the table. Unlike alternatives of exhaustive contrast, here they don\u2019t need to be exclusive. Another factor is focality . Some of the typical cases include clefts, answers to wh-questions, comparative constructions, focus constructions, etc: melinye s\u00e9 apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love HIM , but not HIM . The answer to a question: ' Whom do you love?' Main purpose of an accented pronoun in such position is to identify a referent as one of several alternatives, or to exhaust the set by dismissing all other alternatives: aistana elye im\u00edca n\u00edsi [VT43/28]. Blessed art THOU amongst women . Exhaustive pronoun implies that only Mary is considered. Tip The difference between stressed and emphatic pronouns then comes to differentiate between these two classes of contrast. Exhaustive contrast is denoted by emphatic pronouns, often appended in translation to English with only or even . Stressed pronouns are used then for weak, identifying contrast.

For if one turned oneself westward . A distinction is made between: direct reflexivity : pronouns which refer back to an element within the same clause/construction; indirect reflexivity : pronouns in a subordinate construction (subordinate clauses, infinitive or participle constructions), which refer back to an element in the main/matrix clause (for subordination, \u219239.2, 39.5): Elerondo quente insen Elrond said to himself . Direct reflexive: inse is the indirect object of quente , and refers to its subject. Elerondo hlasse sa Elessar quente sen Elrond heard what Aragorn told him . Indirect reflexive: sen refers back to the subject of hlasse , but syntactically is a part of the dependent clause. Tip Like English, Quenya doesn't use reflexive pronouns with introverted actions unlike many other languages, preferring bare intransitive verbs. Typical extroverted verbs are transitive verbs like 'kill', 'hate', 'criticize', 'see', 'attack', and typical introverted verbs are verbs like 'wash', 'shave', 'dress', 'defend'. Some introverted actions might be expressed by the mediopassive voice, but only with certain verbs ('verbs of grooming', \u219235.11). Extroverted actions always require a pronoun. The following pronouns are used in reflexive constructions: the reflexive pronoun ( imne , imule , inse , etc., \u21927.3); (oblique cases of) the personal pronoun ( ni , lye, se`, etc., \u21927.2); reflexive inflection. Note A distinction should thus be maintained between 'reflexive pronouns' (a morphological category, referring to a specific type of pronoun, inse , etc.) and 'pronouns used in reflexive constructions' (a syntactic phenomenon). While reflexive pronouns always express reflexivity, reflexivity is not always necessarily marked by the use of a reflexive pronoun.

Most of the examples are taken from the Late Quenya corpus, but if the example was adapted from earlier materials, the reference has an additional remark. Chapters 42 to 54 deal with the various types of subordinate constructions found in complex sentences (subordinate clauses, participles, and infinitives): these will be separately introduced in chapter 41. The Sentence Core Predicate, Subject, Object, Complement Most sentences (for the exceptions, \u2192 28.12 ) contain at least a predicate (nearly always a finite verb) and one or more obligatory constituents that belong to that predicate; together these make up the sentence core . Nearly all verbs take at least one obligatory constituent, a subject . Subjects are marked by the common case (\u2192 32.2 ), and predicates agree with it in number (\u2192 29.1 ). Some verbs take only a subject: tintilar predicate i\u00b7eleni subject [RGEO/58]. The stars twinkle . i\u00b7arcanwar subject tauvar predicate [PE22/147]. The thrones endure . ulo subject \u00fava predicate [PE22/167]. The rain is coming . Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the direct object , which is also marked by the common case (\u2192@@); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called complements ): Varda subject m\u00e1ryat object ortane predicate [LotR/377]. Varda has uplifted her hands . ilye tier object undul\u00e1ve predicate lumbule subject [LotR/377]. All paths are drowned deep in shadows . ort\u00edrielyanna complement rucimme predicate [VT44/5]. We fly to thy patronage . i\u00b7hyarma subject tentane predicate Melcorello object [VT49/7]. The left hand pointed away from Melkor . Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object , which is marked by the dative case (\u2192@@); other verbs take a second complement in the common case: Varda subject enquantuva predicate i\u00b7yulma object nin indirect object [VT49/7]. Varda will fill the cup for me . l\u00e1 navin predicate caritalya\u00b7s object m\u00e1ra complement [PE22/154]. I don't advise you to do so . In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, \u2192 26.15-20 ). Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are: prepositional phrases (consisting of a preposition and its complement): i subject or ilye mahalmar complement ea predicate [UT/305]. Who is above all thrones . adverbs : lende predicate tanna complement Nieliccilis subject [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le . subordinate clauses : savin predicate i Elessarno quetie naite object [PE22/158]. I believe that the words of Aragorn are true . The declarative subordinate clause (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate savin : compare Elessar in savin Elessar 'I believe Aragorn' . infinitive constructions : man subject cenuva predicate f\u00e1na cirya c\u00edra object [MC/221]. Who shall see a white ship leave . The common-and-infinitive construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate cenuva : compare and\u00fane in man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? 'Who shall see the last evening?' participle constructions : lie subject tatallaner predicate i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina object [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The common-and-participle construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate tatallaner : compare i\u00b7m\u00e1r in tatallanen i\u00b7m\u00e1r 'I marveled at the house' . When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a complex sentence . For complex sentences, \u2192@@. Note The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus fir\u00eb die has a valency of one, anta give has a valency of three. Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb cir\u00eb , when it takes only a subject, means sail , but may also take an object and then means cut . The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence. It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as tanna in (11) , and with verbs which may have different valencies. In reality, syntactic 'obligatoriness' is better seen as a scale, with constituents being more or less obligatory depending on the verb and construction used. There are a few verbs which do not have a subject ('impersonal' verbs, \u2192@@), and very few of these take no other obligatory constituents (i.e. have a valency of zero). The sentence core then consists of nothing but the verb: e.g. \u00fala it is raining . 'Omission' of the Subject and Other Constituents That a verb takes a certain number of obligatory constituents does not mean that all those constituents are necessarily expressed every single time that verb is used. A constituent may be omitted if it is sufficiently clear from the context who or what is meant: roccor i\u00b7Erulingaron m\u00e1re n\u00e1r? N\u00e1r [PE22/166]. The horses of Rohirrim are good, are they not? They are . The second sentence has no explicit subject \u2014 'horses' has been the subject of the previous sentence and need not be mentioned explicitly again. Note that these constituents have to be supplied in translation ('they'). savin Elessar ar i n\u00e1ne aran Ond\u00f3reo [PE22/158]. I believe Aragorn, and that he was a King of Gondor . Elessar doesn\u2019t need to be mentioned explicitly again. \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende [PE22/166]. Close the door . English, too, normally omits the subject with imperatives. h\u00b7ore nin carita\u00b7s n\u00f3 namin alasaila [VT41/13]. I would like to do so but judge it unwise . Note how the second sentence has no explicit object, added in the translation ('it') 1 . The lack of an explicit, separately expressed subject is particularly frequent in Quenya, and constitutes a regular feature of the language. Information about the subject of a verb is then usually expressed by the personal ending of that verb: merin sa h\u00b7aryalye galasse n\u00f3 vanyalye Ambarello [MS/1]. I hope that you have happiness before you pass from the world . The subjects ('I', 'you') are expressed by the first- and second-person singular endings. melinye\u00b7s apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love him but not him (the other) . The subjects ('I') is expressed by the first-person singular ending, while the first object ('him') by singular object clitic. In the third person, the omission of the subject is regular if the subject of the previous sentence is continued, as in (15) . If the subject changes, an explicitly expressed subject is normally required [VT49/14-15]. In the first and second person, explicitly expressed subjects (in the form of the personal pronouns n\u00ed , ly\u00e9 , etc.) are used only for emphasis or contrast. For such 'contrastive' pronouns, \u2192@@. Note The omission of other elements than the subject (such as the object in (18) ) is much more restricted and infrequent than the lack of an explicitly expressed subject. The object can be substituted for a short clitic form which closely follows the verb (20) in third person only. Linking Verb, Predicative Complement A linking verb (or copulative / copular verb , copula ) 'links' a subject to a nominal constituent, the so-called predicative complement , which identifies the subject or assigns a property to it. The predicative complement is usually an adjective which agrees in case and number with the subject, or a noun which agrees with the subject in case (\u2192 27.7 , @@). Examples of verbs that can function as linking verbs are na be , ol\u00eb become , lar\u00eb remain, stay , nem\u00eb seem, appear to be, prove to be , etc. [ vanwa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb ] predicate Valimar subject [LotR/377]. Lost is Valimar . [ n\u00e9se linking verb n\u00f3rima rocco predicative noun phrase ] predicate [VT49/29]. He was a horse strong at running . Note Predicative nouns or adjectives are sometimes called 'predicate nouns/adjectives'. Predicative complements agreeing with a subject are also sometimes called 'subject(ive) complements'. Linking verbs also occur with an adverbial expression of place or circumstance as their complement: e.g. n\u00e1 be (somewhere), find oneself (somewhere) . But normally special verbs of position are used instead: tul\u00eb get somewhere , har\u00eb stay somewhere . In many grammatical treatments, such complements are also seen as predicative complements: n\u00ed subject [ nauva linking verb tanome complement ] predicate [VT49/19]. I will be there . The verb n\u00e1 , unlike its English counterpart, doesn\u2019t occur in the meaning exist . An expression like tasse n\u00e1 'there is' can have only contrastive meaning 'but not here'. In the ' existential ' use, the verb ea with only a subject is used instead. The verb tule also has an existential use, and then means happen : vahaia n\u00f3re subject ea predicate i ga\u00b7esta Valinor [ MQ : PE22/124]. Far a way there is a land called Valinor . Some other verbs link an object to a predicative complement that agrees with that object (both are in the common). Examples of such verbs are consider X (to be) Y, make X Y, appoint X as Y (for more details, \u2192@@): alasaila n\u00e1 l\u00e1 care tai object mo subject [ nave verb m\u00e1ra predicative adjective ] predicate [PE22/154]. It is unwise not to do what one judges good . Note Predicative complements agreeing with an object are sometimes called 'object(ive) complements'. Omission of a Linking Verb: Nominal Sentences Frequently, a linking verb such as na is lacking in a sentence, whose core then contains only nominal elements. This occurs especially in the following cases: when predicative adjective follows the subject: i\u00b7roccor subject rindi predicate [ MQ : PE21/78]. The horses are swift . Elessarno quetie subject naite predicate [PE22/158]. The words of Aragorn are true . Unless the subject is not expressed, or is separated from a predicate: y\u00e1 hr\u00edve mene, ringa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb [VT49/23]. When winter comes, it is cold . Impersonal use (lit. 'cold is'); for this, \u2192@@. vanwa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb , R\u00f3mello vanwa, Valimar subject ! [LotR/377]. Lost, lost to those from the east is Valimar! if the subject is postponed, but is separated from a predicate with a definite article: mana predicate i\u00b7coimas Eldaron subject [PM/395]. What is the 'coimas' of the Eldar? aistana predicate i\u00b7y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo subject [VT43/31]. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb . with explicit pronouns: aistana predicate elye subject im\u00edca n\u00edsi [VT43/28]. Blessed art thou amongst women . with adverbs of position and direction: tasse i\u00b7osto [ MQ : PE22/124]. There is the city . manna l\u00e9 sinnar [ MQ : PE22/124]. Where are you going this morning? with prepositional phrases: i\u00b7H\u00e9ru as\u00b7elye prepositional phrase [VT43/28]. The Lord is with thee . quiquie menin coaryanna, ar\u00b7se prepositional phrase [VT49/23]. Whenever I get to his house, he is out . in formulaic questions: ma naite? [PE22/166]. Is it true? Only the present indicative of na be is regularly omitted as linking verb in this way: other forms such as imperfect n\u00e1ne or future nauva are not normally omitted, unless other indications of time are present, especially in expressions of location or direction of movement: masse l\u00e9 enar? [ MQ : PE22/124]. Where will you be tomorrow? Optional Constituents Adverbial Modifiers and Other Optional Constituents Many core sentences are elaborated by one or more optional ( non-obligatory ) constituents, which can be left out without making the sentence ungrammatical, and which supplement the sentence core in various ways. Most often such constituents are adverbial modifiers . Such optional constituents can be expressed by: adverbs : tas cennen n\u00f3time eldali [PE22/155]. I saw a few elves there . Adverbial modifier of place. noun phrases and pronouns (in the common, dative or adverbial case, \u2192@@): \u00e1\u00b7men anta s\u00edra ilaurea massamma [VT43/12]. Give us this day our daily bread . Adverbial modifier of time, expressed by the common, \u2192@@. s\u00ed man i\u00b7yulma nin enquantuva? [LotR/377]. Who now shall refill the cup for me? Constituent representing the beneficiary/interested party, expressed by the dative, \u2192@@. Such constituents are often taken as indirect objects, but unlike indirect objects with verbs of giving, etc. (for which \u2192 26.3 ), they are optional. prepositional phrases : nai amanya onnalya ter coivierya [VT49/41]. May your child be blessed throughout their life . Adverbial modifier of time. And in the case of complex sentences, by: subordinate clauses : y\u00e1 hr\u00edve mene, ringa n\u00e1 [VT49/23]. When winter comes, it is cold . The temporal subordinate clause (\u2192@@) serves as an adverbial modifier of time. participle constructions (also \u2192 26.22 ): man tiruva f\u00e1na cirya gear falastala [MC/222]. Who shall heed a white ship, while the sea is surging . The common absolute construction serves as an adverbial modifier of time. Adverbial modifiers operate on different 'levels' of the sentence: The adverbial modifiers in examples ( 39 )-( 44 ) express such semantic categories as the place where, the time when, the circumstance(s) under which, the manner in which, the reasons because of which, etc., the action expressed by a predicate takes place. Adverbial modifiers functioning at this level (i.e. those which have scope over (the verb in) the core sentence) are often called adjuncts . Adverbial modifiers may also have scope over a constituent only, modifying nouns, attributive modifiers, other adverbial modifiers, etc. (such adverbial modifiers are called subjuncts ): y\u00e9ni \u00fan\u00f3time ve r\u00e1mar aldaron [LotR/377]. Long years numberless as the wings of trees . The prepositional phrase ve r\u00e1mar aldaron modifies \u00fan\u00f3time which itself is an attributive modifier with y\u00e9ni . Some other adverbial modifiers are, syntactically speaking, more detached, and have scope over the sentence as a whole, expressing the attitude of the speaker towards the reality or desirability of the content of his sentence, or his attitude towards the form or style of the sentence (such modifiers are often called disjuncts ): an c\u00e9 mo querne cendele n\u00famenna, ve senya [VT49/22]. For if one turned the face westward, as was usual . The phrase ve senya expresses the speaker's attitude towards the reality of the content of the sentence. Melco mardello lende: m\u00e1rie [ MQ : LR/72]. Melko has gone from Earth: it is good . The idiomatic phrase m\u00e1rie expresses the speaker's attitude towards their utterance. Finally, grammars typically recognize a fourth type of adverbial modifier, that of conjuncts , which indicate how one sentence or larger unit of text relates to its surrounding context,i.e. which play role in structuring a text; such forms are treated in this grammar as connective discourse particles , @@: an Varda maryat ortane ar h\u00edzie unt\u00fapa m\u00edri [LotR/377]. For Varda raised her hands, and mist covers jewels . \u00e1la\u00b7me tula \u00fasactienna mal \u00e1\u00b7me etelecta ulcullo [VT43/12]. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil . Noun Phrases Elements of the Noun Phrase In most of the examples above, constituents take the form of a noun phrase. A noun phrase consists of (at least) a head , and (possibly) various kinds of modifiers which are added to the head. For example, in each of the examples below, a noun phrase serves as object to a predicate: antanen [ hatal head ] object sena [VT49/14]. I cast a spear at him . man [ i\u00b7 modifier yulma head ] object nin enquantuva [LotR/377]. Who will refill a cup for me? h\u00edzie unt\u00fapa [ Calaciryo modifier m\u00edri head ] object [LotR/377]. Mist covers the jewels of Calacirya . Sometimes noun phrase can become quite long and nested: linte modifier yuldar head [ lisse modifier miruv\u00f3reva head ] modifier m\u00ed oromardi And\u00fane pella Vardo nu luini tellumar modifier [LotR/377]. Swift draughts of sweet nectar in the high halls beyond the West under blue domes of Varda . Types of Modifier The following types of modifier agree with the head in number (for the agreement in case, \u2192 27.7 ): numerals : ordinal numerals such as minya first , attea second (for details, \u2192@@); among the ordinals may also be reckoned adjectives such as jana other and ecsa other , enta another , and several others; demonstrative , indefinite , interrogative , and possessive pronouns (for details, \u2192@@): \u00e1vatyara mello [ menye modifier roctar head ] noun phrase [ draft : VT43/11]. Forgive us our trespasses . menye agrees with roctar . quantifiers : certain adjectives indicating quantity, such as n\u00f3tima some , few , ilya every , each : i Eru i or [ ilye modifier mahalmar head ] noun phrase [UT/305]. The One who is above all thrones for ever . ilye agrees with mahalmar . tas cennen [ n\u00f3tim\u00eb modifier eldali head ] noun phrase [PE22/155]. I saw a few elves there . attributive genitive II : noun phrases in the adjectival case act as quasi-adjectives (for details, \u2192@@): Valar ar Maiar fantaner nassentar fanainen ve [ quenderinwe modifier coar ar larmar head ] noun phrase [PE17/174]. Valar cloaked their true-being like to Elvish bodies and raiment . quenderinwe agrees with coar ar lamar . eldarinwe modifier leperi ar notessi head [VT47/4]. The Elvish Fingers and Numerals . eldarinwe agrees with leperi ar notessi . (other) adjectives and participles (\u2192@@): luini modifier tellumar head [LotR/377]. Blue domes . racine modifier tengui head [VT39/6]. Stripped signs . Note In the noun phrase only one (typically, the last) element receives the case ending, for more details, \u2192@@. For the relative ordering of such modifiers, particularly with respect to the article, \u2192@@. Most of these pronouns and adjectives/participles may also have a predicative relationship with a noun, either as predicative complement (\u2192 26.8 above) or as predicative modifier (\u2192 26.22 below). The following types of modifier do not agree with the head: the definite article (for a full treatment, \u2192@@); numerals: cardinal numbers such as min one , atta two (for details, \u2192@@); noun phrases/pronouns in the genitive I very frequently serve as modifier in a noun phrase (for details, \u2192@@): savin [ Elessarno modifier quetie head ] noun phrase [VT49/28]. I believe the words of Aragorn . zindar [ i modifier Eldar head Malariando modifier ] noun phrase [PE21/77]. Grey are the Elves of Beleriand . Note For the relative ordering of such genitives and the article (if present), \u2192@@. In several uses, the genitive I may also be used as predicative complement, \u2192@@. active participles : man cenuva menel ac\u00fana rucsal' ambonnar [MC/222]. Who shall see the heavens bending upon crumbling hills . adverbs or prepositional phrases : [ zindanoriello modifier mornie head ] noun phrase caita [LotR/377]. Out of a grey country darkness lies . linte yuldar head m\u00ed oromardi modifier [RGEO/58]. Swift draughts in lofty draughts . relative clauses (for a full treatment, @@). Types of Head The head of a noun phrase is typically a noun, such as yulma ; proper names also belong to this class: a aina Mar\u00eda, arca atarme [VT44/12]. Holy Mary, pray for us . Elendil Vorondo voronwe [UT/305]. Of the faith of Elendil the Faithful . Most of the kinds of modifiers listed above (\u2192 26.16-17 ) may also serve as head, however, particularly when they are modified by the article (\u2192@@): adjectives and participles ; sometimes with the article, sometimes with other modifiers as well: a vanima, vanim\u00e1lion nostari [LotR/981]. O beautiful ones, parents of beautiful children . ilyain antalto annar lestanen Il\u00favat\u00e1ren [ MQ : LR/72]. To all they gave in measure the gifts of Il\u00favatar . nactana l\u00f3 T\u00farin [VT49/24]. Slain by Turin . Note If participle had dependent words, the relative clause would be used in its stead: nai tiruvantes i h\u00e1rar mahalmassen mi N\u00famen [UT/305]. May those who sit upon thrones of the West keep watch over it . i carir quettar \u00f3mainen [WJ/391] Those who form words with voices . Assumption attributive genitives , adverbs and prepositional phrases ; always with the article: ral\u00e1'n Ingar\u00e1no'n Ingaranna, mal i\u00b7Eruo'n Erunna Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's . Pronominal and Adnominal Use of Pronouns, Quantifiers and Cardinal Numerals In addition to the types of head treated above, various pronouns and quantifiers and (occasionally) cardinal numerals can serve as head. For these forms, a distinction is made between: the pronominal use , when the pronoun/quantifier serves as head; the adnominal use , when the pronoun/quantifier serves as modifier. In the pronominal use, such forms typically cannot be modified by the article or other modifiers (there are exceptions, however); in other words, such pronouns/quantifiers then function as noun phrases by themselves : lumbule undul\u00e1ve ilye tier [RGEO/59]. Shadow swallowed all roads . Adnominal use. arimelda ilyaron [PE17/57]. Dearest of all . Pronominal use. Note Personal, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns are used only pronominally (\u2192@@). For so-called 'autonomous' relative clauses (i.e. relative clauses serving as noun phrases by themselves), @@. Apposition Apposition is the placement of two words or word groups parallel to each other without any coordinating particle ( ta or ar , @@), with one, the 'appositive' defining or modifying the other. In this way, two noun phrases (each with their own head), may together serve as a single constituent: aistana [ i y\u00e1ve head m\u00f3nalyo ] [ Y\u00e9sus ] head [VT43/31]. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus . The combined phrase i y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo Y\u00e9sus is a subject. [ Elainen head ] [ t\u00e1rin head Periandion ] ar [ meldenya head any\u00e1ran ] [VT49/40]. To Elaine, queen of Hobbits and my very old friend . The whole quote is a combined phrase serving as an indirect object. For agreement in apposition, \u2192 27.15-16 . Predicative Modifiers Some constituents simultaneously serve as adverbial modifier and to modify the head of a noun phrase. Such constituents are called predicative modifiers : they occur in the form of adjectives and especially participles, which agree with their noun in case. For example: ampanaina i\u00b7m\u00e1r ga\u00b7tatallane\u00b7s [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The participle ampanaina agrees with the subject i\u00b7m\u00e1r : it describes the house. At the same time, it serves as an adverbial modifier, describing the circumstances/time of occurence. man hlaruva carcar yarra izilme ilcalasse [MC/222]. Who shall hear the rocks snarling in the moon gleaming? The participle ilcalasse agrees with izilme ; it describes the moon. At the same time, it serves as an adverbial modifier, describing the circumstances/time of rocks\u2019 snarling. Note For this so-called 'circumstantial' use of the participle in, @@. For the position of predicative modifiers relative to their head and the article (if present), \u2192@@. Elements Interrupting or Outside the Syntax of a Sentence Parentheses Sentences may be interrupted by other sentences \u2014 parentheses . These are often relatively short, and frequently contain some form of comment, as in: l\u00e1 caritas, navin , alasaila n\u00e1 [PE22/154]. Not doing this would be, I think, unwise . \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende, mecin [PE22/166]. Close the door, please . Elements 'Outside' the Syntax of a Sentence Some elements stand 'outside' the sentence, i.e. they are not part of the syntactic structure of predicates, complements and modifiers. The most important of these are: forms of address (\u2192@@): a Aina Faire, Eru \u00f3rava o\u00b7mess\u00eb [VT44/15]. God, the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us . exclamations , interjections , etc. (also, in answers, n\u00e1 yes ): mal \u00e1\u00b7me etelecta ulcullo: n\u00e1sie [VT43/23]. But deliver us from evil: Amen . Arwen vanimelda, nam\u00e1rie [LotR/352]. Arwen beautiful and beloved, farewell . e man antav\u00e1ro [ MQ : LR/63]. What will he give indeed? Also, nai elye hiruva [LotR/378]. \u21a9","title":"28. Simple Sentences"},{"location":"syntx/sen/#introduction-to-simple-sentences","text":"Below, the basic syntactic principles and concepts that will be relevant in chapters 29 to 40 are discussed. Most of the examples are taken from the Late Quenya corpus, but if the example was adapted from earlier materials, the reference has an additional remark. Chapters 42 to 54 deal with the various types of subordinate constructions found in complex sentences (subordinate clauses, participles, and infinitives): these will be separately introduced in chapter 41.","title":"Introduction to Simple Sentences"},{"location":"syntx/sen/#the-sentence-core","text":"","title":"The Sentence Core"},{"location":"syntx/sen/#psoc","text":"Most sentences (for the exceptions, \u2192 28.12 ) contain at least a predicate (nearly always a finite verb) and one or more obligatory constituents that belong to that predicate; together these make up the sentence core . Nearly all verbs take at least one obligatory constituent, a subject . Subjects are marked by the common case (\u2192 32.2 ), and predicates agree with it in number (\u2192 29.1 ). Some verbs take only a subject: tintilar predicate i\u00b7eleni subject [RGEO/58]. The stars twinkle . i\u00b7arcanwar subject tauvar predicate [PE22/147]. The thrones endure . ulo subject \u00fava predicate [PE22/167]. The rain is coming . Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the direct object , which is also marked by the common case (\u2192@@); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called complements ): Varda subject m\u00e1ryat object ortane predicate [LotR/377]. Varda has uplifted her hands . ilye tier object undul\u00e1ve predicate lumbule subject [LotR/377]. All paths are drowned deep in shadows . ort\u00edrielyanna complement rucimme predicate [VT44/5]. We fly to thy patronage . i\u00b7hyarma subject tentane predicate Melcorello object [VT49/7]. The left hand pointed away from Melkor . Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object , which is marked by the dative case (\u2192@@); other verbs take a second complement in the common case: Varda subject enquantuva predicate i\u00b7yulma object nin indirect object [VT49/7]. Varda will fill the cup for me . l\u00e1 navin predicate caritalya\u00b7s object m\u00e1ra complement [PE22/154]. I don't advise you to do so . In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, \u2192 26.15-20 ). Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are: prepositional phrases (consisting of a preposition and its complement): i subject or ilye mahalmar complement ea predicate [UT/305]. Who is above all thrones . adverbs : lende predicate tanna complement Nieliccilis subject [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le . subordinate clauses : savin predicate i Elessarno quetie naite object [PE22/158]. I believe that the words of Aragorn are true . The declarative subordinate clause (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate savin : compare Elessar in savin Elessar 'I believe Aragorn' . infinitive constructions : man subject cenuva predicate f\u00e1na cirya c\u00edra object [MC/221]. Who shall see a white ship leave . The common-and-infinitive construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate cenuva : compare and\u00fane in man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? 'Who shall see the last evening?' participle constructions : lie subject tatallaner predicate i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina object [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The common-and-participle construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate tatallaner : compare i\u00b7m\u00e1r in tatallanen i\u00b7m\u00e1r 'I marveled at the house' . When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a complex sentence . For complex sentences, \u2192@@. Note The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus fir\u00eb die has a valency of one, anta give has a valency of three. Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb cir\u00eb , when it takes only a subject, means sail , but may also take an object and then means cut . The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence. It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as tanna in (11) , and with verbs which may have different valencies.

A distinction can be made between absolute tense and relative tense: Absolute tense concerns the location of an action in the past, present or future, relative to the moment of speaking: The Noldor burned Alqualonde. past The Noldor are burning Alqualonde. present The Noldor will burn Alqualonde. future Relative tense concerns the location of an action in time relative to another temporal reference point given in the context , either prior to that reference point ( anteriority ), at the same time as that reference point ( simultaneity ), or after it ( posteriority ): We arrived when the Noldor had burned Alqualonde. anterior to a moment in the past We arrived when the Noldor were burning Alqualonde. simultaneous with a moment in the past By the time we arrive, the Noldor will have burned Alqualonde. anterior to a moment in the future The Noldor said that they would burn Alqualonde. posterior to a moment in the past The indicatives of the Quenya verb, when used in main clauses, express absolute tense: the present indicative and perfect indicative refer to the present (i.e. the moment of speaking); the imperfect and preterite refer to the past ; the future indicative refers to the future : EXAMPLES Outside main clauses, indicatives frequently receive a relative-tense interpretation in addition to, or instead of, an absolute-tense interpretation (@@ below). IMAGE Aspect Grammatical Aspect Grammatical aspect (usually simply called 'aspect') concerns the way in which an action is presented or regarded, particularly with respect to its internal composition: it can be presented as a single and complete whole (an action in its entirety), without any separate component parts of the action being envisaged, or as incomplete (an action that is ongoing or repeated, that can conceivably be interrupted), with several component parts being envisaged. Note that what matters is not whether an action has component parts, but whether the speaker is interested in presenting these component parts as relevant. The tense-aspect stems of the Quenya verb express three different aspectual values: The present stem presents an action as incomplete , focusing on one or more of its intermediate stages, but leaving its boundaries (beginning and end) out of focus. It thus normally signifies that an action is ongoing or repeated . This is called continuous aspect . The aorist stem has a temporal value but no aspectual one: they are aspectually neutral , and make no formal distinction between an imperfective (incomplete) or perfective (complete) presentation of actions. This is called simple aspect . The perfect stem presents an action as a state resulting from a preceding completed action, or it signifies that the effects of the completed action are somehow still relevant . As the above definitions indicate, the selection of a specific stem (grammatical aspect) depends not so much on any objective properties of the action itself (for such objective properties, \u2192XX), but on a speaker's (subjective) needs and choices in presenting an action in a certain way. What matters most is whether a speaker is interested in drawing attention to any component parts (or conversely, the boundaries) of an action. Lexical Aspect Lexical aspect refers to the temporal structure of a specific action inherent in the verb's meaning: does it have duration, and is it directed towards an end-point? As opposed to grammatical aspect, lexical aspect thus has to do with the objective properties of an action, rather than with subjective ways of presenting that action. TBD Tense and Aspect Combined: The Indicative in Main Clauses Basic Values of the Indicative; Narrative and Non-Narrative Text The Ten Indicatives of Quenya: Basic Values Sections @@-@@ give an overview of the use of indicatives in main clauses (for indicatives in subordinate clauses, \u2192@@ and chapters @@-@@). The interpretation of indicatives depends in the first place on the interaction between tense and grammatical aspect . Combining the aspectual and temporal values described above, the Quenya indicative expresses the following tense/aspect-distinctions (using the verb car\u00eb make as an example): The present simple (or present aorist ) expresses an action, located at the moment of speaking (i.e. in the present), that is presented as repeated : carin I (habitually) make The present continuous (or simply present ) expresses an action, located at the moment of speaking (i.e. in the present), that is presented as ongoing : c\u00e1ran I am making The past simple (or past aorist ) expresses an action, located in the past , presented as a complete whole: carne I made The past continuous (or imperfect ) expresses an action, located in the past , that is presented as ongoing or repeated : c\u00e1rane I was making / I (habitually) made The future expresses an action (either as a single occurrence or as ongoing/repeated), located in the future : caruva I will make / I will be making The perfect expresses a state , located at the present , that is the result of a completed action; or it expresses that the effects of the completed action are still in some way relevant at the present: ac\u00e1rien I have made (< and it exists) The following table provides an overview of the seven indicatives: Tense Present Past non-prospective prospective non-prospective prospective Aspect Simple aorist future past (aorist) past future Continuous present imperfect Perfect perfect future perfect pluperfect past future perfect Narrative and Non-Narrative Text The type of text in which an indicative (in a main clause) is used is often significant in interpretation. A (rough) distinction may be drawn here between narrative and non-narrative text: Narrative text is storytelling: it relates (usually in chronological order) a sequence of actions that took place in the (real or fictive) past, and how they are related to each other. It normally contains a mix of imperfects/pluperfects and past aorist indicatives together with historical aorists. Examples: historical accounts and tales. Non-narrative text is everything else. Main verbs will normally be indicatives of the aorist, present, past, perfect and future, with other moods used apart from the indicative. Examples: most dialogues, discussions, arguments, general descriptions of habits and customs. The use of indicatives in narrative is treated in detail in @@.@@-@@, including some phenomena which are peculiar to narrative contexts. Present Basic Uses The present continuous refers to actions that occur at the moment of speaking . By virtue of its intraterminal aspect (incomplete), it is used by default to refer to actions which are ongoing at the moment of speaking: \u00f3renya qu\u00e9ta nin [VT41/13]. My heart is saying to me Sinar Orome i\u00b7tauresse faralye [MQ: PE22/116]. Today Orome is hunting in the forest . Assumption based on Classical Greek and Turkish The ongoing action referred to by the present continuous may have begun long before the moment of speaking, and an expression of duration is sometimes added: Elessar ando c\u00fania Elessar has been a king for a long time Observe that Engl. here prefers a present perfect (continuous) . The present is also frequently used with states which are true at the moment of speaking: h\u00edsie unt\u00fapa Calaciryo m\u00edri oiale [LotR/377].

I am not coming (I say) Specific Interpretations With telic verbs such as ???, the present stem may refer to an (unsuccessful) attempt, because it indicates that the end-point of the action has so far not been reached. This is called the conative interpretation of the present: EXAMPLES Aorist The aorist indicative is used very often in narrative texts (for details on its use there, \u2192@@); however, it also has a few specific uses outside narrative.

Basic Uses The aorist is used to refer to repeated or habitual actions: Orome tauresse fara Orome hunts in forests [MQ: PE22/116] The aorist is used to refer to general or timeless truths which are continuously in effect: imbi Menel Cemenye mene R\u00e1no tie [VT47/11]. Between Heaven and Earth goes the path of the Moon The aorist is also used in: proverbs: csar\u00e1re psare z\u00fale longing frets the spirit vivid present as in telling stories or jokes: auta i\u00b7l\u00f3me the night is passing laurie lantar lassi like gold fall the leaves antanen hatal sena I cast a spear at him zindan\u00f3riello caita mornie out of a grey country darkness lies common expressions: mecin please Verbs of state of mind , e.g. know , believe , think , love , express state that involves no change, and both the present and the aorist effectively carry the same aspectual meaning, could be considered nearly synonymous, and thus, could be interchangeably used to entail certain meanings: istanye\u00b7s I know it istyanye\u00b7s I know it An aorist form of these verbs is certainly more common, however, particularly with quasi-modal verbs: polin quet\u00eb I can speak [PE17/181] Tip Where the aorist and the present are interchangeable, the aorist has a connotation of characterization , while the present that of observation . Specific Interpretations The aorist indicative of tul\u00eb come and similar verbs normally refers to the future: ni qete sa e\u00b7tule I say that he is coming [PE22/119] Observe that this does not normally hold for forms other than the aorist. In certain contexts, speakers can refer to a single action begun and completed at (approximately) the moment of speaking \u2014 the instantaneous aorist . A frequent context for this use is that of performatives , first-person indicatives which describe the speech act of which they are part (and thus refer to actions that are completed as soon as the utterance is completed): la navin caritalyas m\u00e1ra I do not advise you to do so [PE22/154] The instantaneous aorist also occurs, rarely, in 'simultaneous narration', i.e. when a speaker narrates a sequence of actions as they occurin the present. This in fact also occurs when speakers present actions in the past as if they occur in the present \u2014 the 'historical aorist'. This use is treated separately in @@.@@ (cf. also the 'aorist for the future', @@.@@). Quenya morphology allows the aorist, present, and future affixes to be used in combination with additional past suffixes. It is common to omit the second suffix except for the first verb in series [PE22/129-130]: tuldes mardanna, latya fendi, yal\u00eb, \u00fa-hlar\u00eb hanquenta, cez\u00eb i-zambessen... he came home, opened the doors, called, heard no answer, searched all the rooms... For the use of the aorist in conditional and counter-factual clauses, \u2192@@. Perfect Basic Uses The perfect indicative signifies that an action has been completed in the immediate past and that the effects of that action are in some way relevant in the present . Cross-linguistically focus of its functions lie on the spectrum between this past action and its current effect. In the extreme cases it can become then either a general past tense or a state, abstracted from its actional component. The following perfect functions are the most common: resultative perfect expresses a more or less permanent state in the present which exists as the result of a completed action in the past: Mary has already arrived y\u00e9ni av\u00e1nier ve lint\u00eb yuldar years have passed away like swift draughts [RGEO/58] experiential perfect : I have never been to Paris \u2192 not attested \u2192 past aorist continuative perfect : Mary has lived in London for five years \u2192 not attested \u2192 present recent past perfect : The Orioles have just won ni\u00b7ut\u00falie nyariello ve atarella *I have just come from talking with your father [PE22/119] Assumption from Greek Especially with telic verbs, active forms of the perfect are often used to emphasize the responsibility of the subject for the state that has resulted from a past action (they are particularly frequent in oratory): EXAMPLE Past Aorist The past aorist is used very often in narrative texts (for details on its use there, \u2192@@.@@-@@); however, it also has a few specific uses outside narrative. Basic Uses The aorist indicative is used to present the occurrence of an action in the past, without reference to its duration or process, but presenting the action asa single, uninterruptable whole. As such, the aorist is the default tense in narrative texts to record single , complete actions : sustan\u00eb Manw\u00ebo s\u00fal\u00eb ten i indo Sindicollo ar he lastan\u00eb ar carnes the spirit of Manwe blew unto the heart of Thingol and he listened and did it [NM/239] In non-narrative text , the past aorist is typically used to observe or conclude that an action has been completed by the moment of speaking. This is sometimes called the constative aorist : manen lamb\u00eb Quendion ahyan\u00eb How did the language of the Elves change? [PM/395] Note Like in Old English, Quenya aorist easily combines with temporal adverbs, including s\u00ed now . In such cases aorist translates to English with present perfect .

Depending on the context, the future indicative can be used for various communicative purposes, such as predictions, statements of intention, announcements, promises, threats, suggestions, etc.: Anar caluva tielyanna The sun shall shine upon your path [UT/22] Sources : \"The Turkish Aorist and Progressive: Present Tense, Future Tense, or What?\" by Mehmet Kanik \"Semantics of the Turkish Non-Past\" by Ryan Caro \"A cross-linguistic perspective on the Greek perfect\" by Konstantinos Askitidis \"Synchronic variation in the Old English Perfect\" by Morgan Macleod","title":"35.

Note that what matters is not whether an action has component parts, but whether the speaker is interested in presenting these component parts as relevant. The tense-aspect stems of the Quenya verb express three different aspectual values: The present stem presents an action as incomplete , focusing on one or more of its intermediate stages, but leaving its boundaries (beginning and end) out of focus. It thus normally signifies that an action is ongoing or repeated . This is called continuous aspect . The aorist stem has a temporal value but no aspectual one: they are aspectually neutral , and make no formal distinction between an imperfective (incomplete) or perfective (complete) presentation of actions. This is called simple aspect . The perfect stem presents an action as a state resulting from a preceding completed action, or it signifies that the effects of the completed action are somehow still relevant . As the above definitions indicate, the selection of a specific stem (grammatical aspect) depends not so much on any objective properties of the action itself (for such objective properties, \u2192XX), but on a speaker's (subjective) needs and choices in presenting an action in a certain way.
