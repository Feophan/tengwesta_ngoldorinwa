Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different subtypes of the fifth declension are distinguished.

Note In Late Quenya 1 final -t became -s , and subtypes (2) and (3) merged into one large group. Assimilated and Other Special Forms Nouns with simple bases have some distinct endings in the singular: bases on -m have genitive-adjective in -nwa , instrumental in -mnen ; bases on -n have genitive-adjective in -nwa , instrumental in - nwen , allative in -nna ; bases on -l have genitive-adjective in -lwa , instrumental in -lmen , ablative in -llo ; bases on -r have genitive-adjective in -rwa , instrumental in -rmen ; bases on -s have genitive-adjective in -rwa , instrumental in -rmen , locative in -sse ; bases on -t have instrumental in -twen . In addition to those, for some old nouns it is possible to encounter similar forms in other cases, which are, however, rarely used in later speech: in ablative : bases on -n , -r and -s can have -llo ; bases on -m can have -lmo ; in locative : bases on -l , -n and -r can have -lde , -nde and -rde ; bases on -l and -t can have -lse and -tse ; in allative : bases on -l can have -lda . Monosyllabic Nouns Monosyllabic nouns belonging to fifth declension can be divided into groups: strong nouns which keep long stem; weak nouns which keep short stem; mixed nouns which have long stem in common , but otherwise short .

Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different subtypes of the fifth declension are distinguished. The differences between these types largely depend on two factors: (type of) the consonant in which the stem ends; length of the vowel in the stem. It is often impossible to derive the stem of a fifth-declension noun (and thus the exact pattern of that noun\u2019s declension) from the common singular alone: the genitive is required to determine which subtype the noun belongs to.
