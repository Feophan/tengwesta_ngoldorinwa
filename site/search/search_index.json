Finite verbs can have a personal ending (@@) and express person or number, and can be modified by mood particles; nonfinite verbs do not have a personal ending and do not express person or mood. Categories Pertaining to All Verb Forms: Tense-Aspect All Quenya verb forms, i.e. both finite and non-finite forms (only participles), are marked for the category of tense-aspect . Tense-aspect : Quenya verb forms fall into three overarching systems, depending on which stem of the verb is used (@@); these three systems differ primarily in their expression of aspect: the aorist-stem system , covering the aorist, the preterite, the future, present active and passive participles; the present-stem system , covering the present and the imperfect; and the perfect-stem system , covering the perfect, the past active and passive participles. Within these systems, tense is expressed by all forms. Aspect is not expressed by participles. Categories Pertaining to Finite Verb Forms All finite verb forms, in addition to belonging to one of the three tense-aspect systems, are also marked for the categories of person and number , and the category of mood . Finite verb forms express one of the following persons : apersonal form (used with expressed subject, @@); first person ('I'/'we (but not you)'/'we (with you)'); second person ('you'); or third person ('he/she'/'it', 'they'); And they express one of the following numbers : singular ('I', 'you', 'he/she'/'it'); plural ('we (but not you)'/'we (with you)', 'you', 'they'); in addition, Quenya has a dual number ('you and I', 'you two','the two of them', @@). Finite verb forms do not express moods , and those are realized as mood particles preceeding the verb (for the uses and meanings of these moods, @@). The following moods are recongnized: indicative ; subjunctive ; optative ; imperative . Finally, indicative forms can be split into basic forms (aorist, present, preterite, imperfect, perfect, future) and derivative forms (future perfect, future imperfect, long perfect (perfect continuous), pluperfect, future-in-the-past). Controversial Derivative forms are extremely rare and should be avoided. Categories Pertaining to Non-finite Verb Forms Non-finite verb forms are marked for the following categories: Infinitives are not marked for any category; Gerunds are marked for case; Participles express tense-aspect and voice, and, like adjectives, are also marked for the categories of case (passive participles are also marked for number, @@); Verbal adjectives are only marked for the categories of case, number and voice. Voice : all Quenya participle forms also express voice, treated in detail in @@. A basic two way distinction between different kinds of forms may be made: active forms; and passive forms. Morphological Building Blocks: Stems, Endings, and Other Markings Verb Stems and Tense-Aspect Stems All forms of a certain verb share a verb stem , which identifies the forms as deriving from that particular verb: for example, in any form of the verb talta (e.g. atalantiemma , taltuvante , talanter ), the verb stem talat- identifies the form as belonging to that particular verb (and thus expressing in some way the meaning fall ). Many Quenya verb stems occur in different variants due to ablaut vowel gradation (@@): for example, the verb stem of the verb ort\u00e4 rise occurs as either ort- (zero grade), orot- (short grade) or \u00f3r- (lengthened grade). Different tense-aspect stems of such verbs differ in the vowel-grade they show. For verbs which have variant verb stems, all variants are given below, where required. Through the addition of endings, augments and ablaut, a tense-aspect stem is formed. The tense-aspect stem identifies the form as having a particular combination of tense-aspect. Six different kinds of tense-aspect stems maybe distinguished; these fall into the three overarching systems described above (@@): aorist tense-aspect: aorist stems, past stems, future stems; present tense-aspect: present stems, imperfect stems; perfect tense-aspect: perfect stems. The mechanisms involved in forming tense-aspect stems from verb stems are detailed in the individual chapters on the present (@@), aorist (@@), and perfect (@@) stems. To-Do Verbs lacking certain tense-aspect stems altogether are called defective verbs . Are there examples of defective verbs in Quenya? PE22/117: verbs like lir- are defective; -ea verbs from -ng- are defective and don't have present tense stem. Thematic Vowels Some elements appear between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect stem ending: Many Quenya verb forms include a thematic vowel (or: 'theme vowel') a standing between the stem and the ending, e.g. ort a uva , hent a nie ; for details, @@ below. Endings Every verb form also has an ending , which provides the information required to identify the form as either finite or non-finite, and sometimes its voice, tense, aspect or mood. These endings are called primary . Note Most often such an ending is referred to as a suffix , but here this term is reserved for a derivative block of a new lexeme. By this defnition, the derivational morphology of verbal adjectives, participles and gerunds like -it\u00eb is a suffix , but preterite -ne is a primary ending . However, for simplicity (particularly due to cases like future participle, where derivational suffix follows its primary ending), they are all discussed under the title of verbal eindings. Some verbal forms can express additional information in their secondary ending : For finite verbs, the 'personal ending' expresses person and number; For infinitive, the 'possessive ending' also expresses person and number; The endings of gerund, participles and verbal adjectives might express case and number. The endings are treated more fully below, @@. Augments and Prepositional Prefixes Finally, some elements precede the stem: perfect stems might include an augment, which takes the form of a root vowel 1 directly preceding the stem (e.g. e-c\u00e9nie ), or, if the verb stem begins with a vowel, either that vowel is lengthened (e.g. \u00falie ) or the syllable is duplicated ( or\u00f3rie ). For details, @@. Many compound verbs begin with a prepositional prefix, an original preposition integrated into the verb form, e.g. ettul\u00eb , aucir\u00eb (@@). These prefixes are always the first element of a form, preceding even augments and reduplications (@@). A final consonant of such prefixes often assimilates to the following sound: e.g. eccez\u00eb but etec\u00e9zie (@@). Assumption If the prefix ends in a vowel, this vowel usually drops out before another vowel (elision, @@). Note For reduplications, @@. Verbal Stems Quenya verbal stems split into seven major groups or conjugations : basic verbs : most numerous group of bare primitive \u221atal shape: cen- ( \u221aken ) see , tul- ( \u221atul ) come , mat- ( \u221amat ) eat ; long verbs : triconsonantal verbs of \u221atalat shape: talat- ( \u221atalat ) fall , carap- ( \u221akarap ) speak , sulup- ( \u221asulup ) drink ; vocalic-progressive or a-verbs : verbs with an inherently continuative sense of \u221atal-\u0101 shape: gala- ( \u221agal-\u0101 ) grow , fara- ( \u221aspar-\u0101 ) hunt , hora- ( \u221askor-\u0101 ) wait ; vocalic-inceptive or u-verbs : verbs often with an inherently inchoactive sense of \u221atal-\u016b shape (with or without a consonantal element): haru- ( \u221akhad-\u016b ) sit down , liru- ( \u221alir-\u016b ) sing , cainu- ( \u221akaj-n\u016b ) lie down ; formative verbs : verbs that add an additional consonant to the stem, usually of inchoactive or anticausative meaning, of \u221atal-t , \u221atal-j or \u221atal-s shape: cait- ( \u221akaj-t ) lie , siry- ( \u221asir-j ) flow , cals- ( \u221akal-s ) shine ; causative verbs : verbs with an inherently causative meaning that add an additional syllable to the stem of \u221atal-ta or \u221atal-ja shape: caita- ( \u221acaj-ta ) lay , tulta- ( \u221atul-ta ) send , tulya- ( \u221atul-ja ) lead ; derivative verbs : verbs formed from nouns or adjectives, with or without addition of derivative elements: tengua- read (from tengua letter ), remba- trap (from rembe net ), telconta- stride (from telco leg ). Together conjugations 2-7 are known as secondary verbs . Thematic and Athematic Conjugations Quenya verb forms are either thematic or athematic. Thematic forms include a thematic vowel a between the verb-stem and the non-finite or tense-aspect ending. Athematic forms do not include a thematic vowel: thus in athematic forms tense-aspect ending is attached immediately to the stem: Thematic conjugations : all forms of causative verbs, aorist-stem forms of all secondary verbs, past-stem forms of progressive verbs, present-, past and perfect-stem forms of derivative verbs, gerund of progressive verbs; Athematic conjugations : all forms of basic verbs, future-stem forms of progressive, formative and derivative verbs, present-, perfect-stem forms of progressive and formative verbs, present-stem forms of progressive verbs, past-stem forms of formative verbs. Some examples with the a-verb (3rd conjugation) fara hunt : faran : 1 sg. aor. thematic: thematic vowel a stands between the ending -n and the aorist-stem; f\u00e1ran : 1 sg. pres. athematic: the tense-aspect ending a is a part of the present-stem; faranen : 1 sg. pret. thematic: thematic vowel a stands between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect ending -ne ; faruvan : 1 sg. fut. athematic: the tense-aspect ending -uva is attached to the verb-stem directly; far\u00e1ve : ger. thematic: thematic vowel a is inserted before the gerundial ending; farite : inf. athematic: the infinitive ending -ita is attached directly to the verb-stem. Assumption No infinitive form but of basic verbs is attested. Some non-finite verbal forms (verbal adjectives in -ite ) include a different thematic vowel \u2014 the root vowel which follows the verbal stems: carait\u00eb busy , coloit\u00eb tolerant . Same thematic vowel is added in deverbal nouns (for these, @@). Endings Endings of Finite Forms The endings of finite verb forms are divided into primary , which mark tense-aspect, and secondary or 'personal' which mark person and number of its subject. Primary Endings Tense-Aspect Endings aorist present preterite perfect future -(\u00eb) -(y)a -(n)e -(n)ie -uva More details in @@. Imperative Ending To-Do Personal Endings The (a)personal endings of finite verb forms are the same for all stems: Apersonal endings mark only number , and they are used when the subject of the verb is explicit ; Personal endings mark number and person when the subject is left implicit ; In singular personal endings can be either short or long depending on euphonic environment. Tables of Endings singular plural dual apersonal \u2014 -r -t first-person incl. -n(ye) -lwe -nque, -ngwe excl. -lme -mme second-person fam. -t(ye) -lde -ste form. -l(ye) third-person -s(e) -lte, -nte -tte honorific -tar -ltar(i), -ntar(i) -star reflexive -sse -tte \u2014 To-Do What is the difference between optional variants? Endings of Non-finite Forms Primary Endings infinitive gerund active participle passive participle -ita -ie, -ve -(i)la -(i)na Note Participles express tense and therefore employ primary endings of both finite and non-finite forms : car-uva-ila that will be doing . They are not marked for aspect, however, so perfect ending is used for past tense , aorist ending for present tense . More details in @@. Possessive Endings Even though non-finite forms don't use secondary 'personal' endings to denote subject like finite forms do, they nonetheless can express it with substantive 'possessive' endings (\u2192@@): caritalya\u00b7s your doing it . For details, @@. Nominal Endings Gerund and participles function as nouns and therefore can receive a case ending . Gerund declines as a second-declension noun (\u2192 4.@@ ), and participles as a first-declension noun (\u2192 4.@@ ). To-Do The write-up is a bit lazy. Return to this section later. Augments and Reduplications Formation of the Augment Perfect-stem forms (though, not only) normally include an augment, which immediately precedes the stem. The form of the augment is determined by the initial sound of the (tense-aspect) stem. With Stems Beginning with a Consonant If the stem begins with a consonant, the augment takes the form of a root vowel : verbal stem perfect stem mat- a-m\u00e1tie tul- u-t\u00falie h\u00b7or- o-h\u00f3rie With stems beginning with strong n , m , ng 2 (\u2192@@), that strong consonant is restored: verbal stem aorist stem perfect stem ndac- nac\u00eb a-nd\u00e1cie mbar- mar\u00eb a-mb\u00e1rie ngor- ngor\u00eb o-ng\u00f3rie Late Tarquesta Eventually those forms were brought into line with aorist stems: nac\u00eb > an\u00e1cie , mar\u00eb > am\u00e1rie . As ng- became n- , it appeared as such: nor\u00eb > on\u00f3rie . With Stems Beginning with a Vowel or Diphthong If the stem begins with a vowel, the augment usually gets absorbed into it with the lengthening (and in lengthened-grade ablaut it disappears): verbal stem perfect stem ap- a-\u00e1pie > \u00e1pie ef- e-\u00e9fie > \u00e9fie ul- u-\u00falie > \u00falie Note A silent g- is purely an orthographic convenience. Stems with it behave like stems beginning with vowels: verbal stem gal- , perfect stem ga-\u00e1lie > g\u00e1lie . It is also common for some verbs (and more generally in verse) to use reduplication instead (see below, @@): Formation of Reduplications Frequentative and sometimes perfect stems are formed by the addition of a reduplication to the verb stem. Reduplications consist of a consonant + root vowel, and may substitute an augment with stems starting with a vowel. Three Types of Reduplication With verb stems beginning with a single consonant, ty- or qu- , strong nasals ( nd- , mb- , ng- ), or other palatilized consonants ( ny- , ly- 3 , j- ): reduplication = initial consonant + root vowel : verbal stem frequentative stem sil- sisilla tyal- tyatyalla ndac- nandacca nyar- nanyarra jam- hajamma With verb stems beginning with a combination of stop + s ( cs- , ps- , ts- ), voiceless liquid ( hl- , hr- ): reduplication = second consonant + root vowel : verbal stem frequentative stem psar- sapsarra csar- sacsarra hlas- lahlassa hris- rihrissa With verb stems beginning with a vowel: reduplication = root vowel + final consonant : verbal stem perfect stem is-t- is-\u00edsie ol- ol-\u00f3lie or-y- or-\u00f3rie Further Particulars Verbal roots of \u221at\u0101 shape frequently show inversion . When this happens, augment and reduplication follow regular 'consonant-first' form: verbal stem stem with augment au-t- < w\u0101-t a-w\u00e1-nie is-t- < s\u012b-t i-si-nte or-y- < r\u014d-j o-ro-nte The Relative Position of Augments, Reduplications and Prefixes Basic Rules Rules In compound verbs that include a prepositional prefix, any augment or reduplication comes after the prefix: entul- > en-u-t\u00falie . also known as \u00f3mataima . \u21a9 The difference is more obvious in transcription schemas that use \u00f1- for initial ngoldo : \u00f1or\u00eb > ong\u00f3rie . \u21a9 If gy- > ly- , something to sort later. \u21a9","title":"12.

Fifth-Declension Nouns Stems and Types of Fifth-Declension Nouns All fifth-declension nouns have a stem ending in a consonant . Although the endings used are generally the same throughout the entire declension (for exceptions, see the individual sections below), a number of different subtypes of the fifth declension are distinguished. The differences between these types largely depend on two factors: (type of) the consonant in which the stem ends; length of the vowel in the stem. It is often impossible to derive the stem of a fifth-declension noun (and thus the exact pattern of that noun\u2019s declension) from the common singular alone: the genitive is required to determine which subtype the noun belongs to.

Note In Late Quenya 14 final -t became -s , and subtypes (2) and (3) merged into one large group. Assimilated and Other Special Forms Nouns with simple bases have some distinct endings in the singular: bases on -m have genitive-adjective in -nwa , instrumental in -mnen ; bases on -n have genitive-adjective in -nwa , instrumental in - nwen , allative in -nna ; bases on -l have genitive-adjective in -lwa , instrumental in -lmen , ablative in -llo ; bases on -r have genitive-adjective in -rwa , instrumental in -rmen ; bases on -s have genitive-adjective in -rwa , instrumental in -rmen , locative in -sse ; bases on -t have instrumental in -twen . In addition to those, for some old nouns it is possible to encounter similar forms in other cases, which are, however, rarely used in later speech: in ablative : bases on -n , -r and -s can have -llo ; bases on -m can have -lmo ; in locative : bases on -l , -n and -r can have -lde , -nde and -rde ; bases on -l and -t can have -lse and -tse ; in allative : bases on -l can have -lda . Monosyllabic Nouns Monosyllabic nouns belonging to fifth declension can be divided into groups: strong nouns which keep long stem; weak nouns which keep short stem; mixed nouns which have long stem in common , but otherwise short .

They follow the polysyllabic declension. Note Sometimes adverbial cases allow two forms: short assimilated ( talse on foot ) or long proper ( talasse on foot ). The former are crystalized adverbs, and the latter are typically used with a specific noun. The difference might be vague at times. Sixth-Declension Nouns Stems and Types of Sixth-Declension Nouns All sixth-declension nouns are irregular vocalic nouns. The first group includes monosyllabic nouns that have a stem ending in a vowel . These nouns decline as nouns of either first or fourth declension, but are often defective and extended to disyllabic forms. f\u00e1 17 breath sg pl com. f\u00e1 f\u00e1r gen.

This is applicable to ablative plural in general. \u21a9 To avoid unpreferrable rVr sequence. Plural on -e is not controversial, appearing in [ DN4 ], [DN5b], [DN5c], and generally agreeing with a behaviour of the final -ai in OP1 and plural adjectives. The situation with -oi is more obscure: [ DN5 ] suggested -oi > -o , while [OP1] \u2014 -oi# > -ui# [PE19/66]. However, [PE19/63] indicates that -ui# > -ue, -uvi .

Thematic and Athematic Aorists Forms built on the aorist stem follow either a thematic or an athematic conjugation. thematic conjugation: all causative tense forms, aorist and preterite tense forms of derivative and a-verbs, aorist tense form of long and formative verbs. athematic conjugation: all basic and u-verbs tense forms, preterite and future tense forms of long and formative verbs, future tense forms of derivative and a-verbs. Tense Endings Tense endings are added after a theme vowel in thematic conjugations, or directly to stem in athematic conjugations. aorist tense endings: -\u00eb in basic, nil everywhere else. preterite tense ending: -(n)e . future tense ending: -uva . Exception The u-verbs might receive the aorist tense-ending when unmarked for number or person, but drop it before secondary ending: haru- > haru(\u00eb) > harun . Sound Changes in Tense Stems Several sound changes become apparent in aorist stems. The most important is metathesis (@@), discussed below. For rhotacism and other, more obscure changes, @@. Metathesis occurs in preterite tense of athematic conjugation, except for u-verbs, and might involve assimilation (@@): cat- > cat-ne > cante , tup- > tup-ne > tumpe , sulup- > sulup-ne > sulumpe . Verbs which experience metathesis: ending in voiceless stops -p , -t , -c : cap-ne > campe , mat-ne > mante , ruc-ne > runce ; ending in voiced stop -d : red-ne > rende ; ending in fricatives -f , -h , -z : raf-ne > rappe , lah-ne > lacce , cez-ne > cesse ; ending in -l : tul-ne > tulle ; ending in -s : hlas-ne > hlasse . Note Ending in -l commonly had an alternative form without metathesis: tul-ne > tulde . Late Tarquesta The combination -mne was pronounced /nne/, but it was not reflected in spelling: nemne /nenne/. Overview of Regular Forms Examples (zero-grade ablaut stems and thematic vowels are highlighted): verb stem aorist tense stem preterite tense stem future tense stem basic cen- cen-\u00eb cen-ne cen-uva vocalic u lir-u- lir-u-(\u00eb) lir-u-ne lir-u-uva > lir\u00fava long talat- talt - a -\u00f8 talat-ne > talante talt -uva formative sir-y- sir -y- a -\u00f8 siri-y-ne > sirinye sir -y-uva vocalic a far-a- far- a -\u00f8 far- a -ne far-uva derivative tengu-a- tengu- a -\u00f8 tengu- a -ne tengu-uva > teng\u00fava causative tul-ta- tul-t- a -\u00f8 tul-t- a -ne tul-t- a -uva Particular Formations Spurious u-Verbs The u-verbs which end in a velar consonant behave transiently between true u-verbs and basic verbs. They receive ending like basic verbs in aorist and preterite: micu- > aorist miqu\u00eb , preterite minque ; but behave like true u-verbs in future: micu-uva > mic\u00fava . Augmented Preterite A special group of formative verbs of \u221at\u0101 shape might form preterite from inverted root with an augment: is-t- > i-si-t-ne > isinte , or-y- > o-ro-t-ne > oronte . The resulting form is superficially the same as from short-grade ablaut: isi-t-ne > isinte , orot-ne > oronte . However, the augment is not a part of the stem, and can be freely omitted, especially if following a vowel (elision, @@): sinte , ronte . The vowel of a short-grade ablaut stem can't be elided. Long Preterite Some basic and formative verbs show a lengthened-grade ablaut in preterite: verbs ending in -b or -w : lab- > l\u00e1ve , tyaw- > ty\u00e1ve ; verbs ending in -d beside regular -nde sometimes reformed either after regular -r verbs to no-metathesis -rne : nid- > nirne ; or, more commonly, to long preterite: yod- > y\u00f3re ; verbs in -y beside regular -ine could have a long preterite form (see below): ray- > r\u00e1ie ; Late Tarquesta later verbs in -l also formed a long preterite: tul- > t\u00fale ; eventually such forms started to spread and become more common: car- > c\u00e1re . Long Future and Contract Future Basic verbs ending in -b or -w show an irregular future form depending on its root vowel: if root vowel is -o- or -u- , the future ending is -ua : tub- > tuvua ; with any other root vowel, the final consonant is dropped: lab- > la-\u00f8-uva > lauva . Verbs in -ea A small and rare group of verbs which show -ea in aorist tenses comprises basic verbs with stems in -ay and a-verbs enging in -e(ng)a : verb stem aorist tense stem preterite tense stem future tense stem basic ray- ray-\u00eb > rea ray-ne > raine ray-uva vocalic a te(ng)a- te- a -\u00f8 te(ng)-ne > tenge te-uva Note The basic verbs in -y blended with formative verbs in -y-t .

The plural form of the verb may, however, be used to emphasize that the subject consists of various individual members: Valar ar Maiar fantaner nassentar fanainen [PE17/174]. Valar and Maiar cloaked their true-being in veils . When there are multiple subjects , the verb will normally be plural. Sometimes, however, especially when the verb precedes a first singular subject, it may be singular: sanome tarne Ol\u00f3rin, Aracorno, Eomer, Imrahil [PE17/71]. There stood Gandalf, Aragorn, Eomer and Imrahil . sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta [LotR/967]. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world .

Neither flood nor time waits for anyone . The verb may agree in number with the subject in meaning rather than in grammatical form: this is called the notional agreement or synesis ; for example, when the subject is singular but refers to a collective, the verb may be plural in form: lie tatallaner i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina [VT49/43]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . tatallaner agrees with singular lie in plural. Head \u2013 Modifier (in Noun Phrases); Predicative Modifiers and Complements Basic Rule Rule Rule 1 : an adjective, passive participle or adnominal pronoun agrees in case and number with the head it modifies. Rule 2 : only one eligible component of a noun phrase receives the case inflection: i\u00b7saila n\u00e9r the wise man (com. sg.) i\u00b7saile neri the wise men (com. pl.) i\u00b7saile nerin to the wise men (dat. pl. head-last) i\u00b7neri sailain to the wise men (dat. pl. head-first) Note Only some numerals decline: for indeclinable numerals, \u2192@@. Other types of modifiers do not agree with their head, particularly attributive genitive I, adverbs, cardinal numerals and prepositional phrases. For examples, \u2192 26.17 . Exceptions Modifier might not agree with its following head in adverbial case : ono alye eter\u00fana me illume ilya racsellor [VT44/9]. But deliver us always from all dangers . ilya doesn\u2019t agree with racsellor in number. man tiruva cirya ondolisse morne [MC/222]. Who shall heed a ship on the dark rocks? morne agrees with ondolisse in number. Note that if modifier receives adverbial case inflection instead, it agrees in number with its head as usual: anar p\u00farea ticta acsor ilcalannar [MC/222]. The sun blinking on the gleaming bones . Modifier might not agree with its following head, if the noun phrase as a whole is a modifier in another noun phrase: aran linta ciryal\u00edva [PE17/147]. King of Swift Ships . A demonstrative pronoun or a qualifier which serves as subject to a linking verb and predicative noun ('this is X') may either agree with that noun, or appear in the neuter: ilya s\u00ed maller raicar [LR/47]. Now all roads are bent . A noun in genitive II case usually behaves as an adjective, but might not agree with a head inflected for case or, in later use, if it takes on the role of genitive: linte yuldar lisse miruv\u00f3reva [RGEO/58]. Swift draughts of the sweet mead . miruv\u00f3reva doesn\u2019t agree with yuldar in number. Antecedent \u2014 Relative Pronoun Basic Rule Rule Rule 1 : a relative pronoun agrees in number and gender with its antecedent, but its case is determined by its syntactical function in the relative clause (for details, \u2192@@): i\u00b7cirya ya c\u00edra the ship which is putting out to sea (sg. inanim. as the antecedent, com. as subject in the relative clause). i\u00b7n\u00e9r yen antanes miquelis the man to who she gave a kiss (sg. anim. as the antecedent, dat. as indirect object in the relative clause). Exceptions The sense construction (\u2192 27.6 ) is possible with relative pronouns. For other exceptions, especially 'relative repulsion', \u2192@@. Apposition An appositive (\u2192 26.21 ) agrees in case with the word it belongs to, but has its own number and gender : Elainen t\u00e1rin Periandion ar meldenya any\u00e1ran [VT49/40]. To Elaine, queen of Hobbits and my very old friend . An appositive to a possessive clitic stands in the case of the host: coarya Olwe [WJ/369]. The house of him, Olwe . tintilar i\u00b7eleni \u00f3maryo l\u00edrinen aire-t\u00e1rio [RGEO/59]. The stars twinkle in her voice\u2019s song, of the holy queen .

Valar and Maiar cloaked their true-being in veils . When there are multiple subjects , the verb will normally be plural. Sometimes, however, especially when the verb precedes a first singular subject, it may be singular: sanome tarne Ol\u00f3rin, Aracorno, Eomer, Imrahil [PE17/71]. There stood Gandalf, Aragorn, Eomer and Imrahil . sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta [LotR/967]. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world . The singular form may also be used with complex conjunctions, for examples \u00fa ... \u00fa 2 neither \u2026 nor , particularly if nouns belong to the same grammatical gender: \u00fa luime \u00fa l\u00fame hora \u00faquen (translation from GN : GL/53). Neither flood nor time waits for anyone . The verb may agree in number with the subject in meaning rather than in grammatical form: this is called the notional agreement or synesis ; for example, when the subject is singular but refers to a collective, the verb may be plural in form: lie tatallaner i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina [VT49/43].

The Quenya equivalent of an indefinite article is the lack of an article: nai elen siluva lyenna [VT49/40]. May a star shine upon you . luini tellumar yassen tintilar i\u00b7eleni [RGEO/58]. Blue domes in which twinkle the stars . The article is 'definite' because it refers to someone/something that is identifiable : the article expresses that it is clear who/what is meant, and that it can be distinguished from other people/things. The article is also 'pragmatic' because it modifies what is identifiable only contrary to common knowledge: when distinguished from a context alone, article is usually omitted. Warning Quenya often doesn\u2019t use the definite article where English would (see examples below). The lack of an article in prose is normally significant, but in poetry the article is omitted much more freely: i\u00b7oromardi tanna lende ar wingildi wilwarindie The wood-spirits and the foam-like butterflies came thither [PE16/96]. The prose version would include definite i\u00b7wingildi instead. Reasons for Pragmatic (Marked) Identifiability of a Referent The referent of a noun is usually identifiable when it has been mentioned before : onortanen rocco. I\u00b7rocco n\u00f3rima n\u00e9 [modified; PE17/168, VT49/29]. I rode a horse. The horse was strong at running . A referent is identifiable when it is made specific by the immediate context : \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende, mecin [PE22/166]. Close the door, please . There\u2019s only one open door in the room. auta i\u00b7l\u00f3me [MC/222]. The night is passing! The night right now . aistana i y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo Y\u00e9sus [VT43/27]. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus . i\u00b7y\u00e1ve becomes identifiable through the information added in the apposition. The article is used if the noun is conceptualized and doesn\u2019t refer to a specific referent: epetai i\u00b7jarma \u00fa ten ulca s\u00edmaryassen [VT49/8]. The left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations . i\u00b7jarma doesn\u2019t refer to a specific left hand, but to a concept of the left hand. Reasons for Semantic (Unmarked) Identifiability of a Referent A referent is identifiable when it is obvious from the immediate context of its relation to another noun (note that English uses the article in many such cases): an c\u00e9 mo querne cendele n\u00famenna [VT49/8]. For if one turned the face westward . cendele is defined uniquely as belonging to a subject of the sentence. However if the relation alone doesn\u2019t identify a referent uniquely, or the relation is missing, the article might be required: i\u00b7equessi R\u00familo [WJ/398]. The Sayings of R\u00famil . The title refers to a specific composition rather than all utterances ever made by the author. ar mi cemen raine i\u00b7h\u00ednin [VT44/33]. And on earth peace, good will toward men . i\u00b7h\u00ednin stands for h\u00ednin Il\u00favat\u00e1ro . Note In a case if a noun refers to something whose possessor or origin is obvious (usually the subject), Quenya, like English, might use a possessive pronoun [TBD], as in: s\u00ed Varda ortane m\u00e1ryat Oiolosseo [RGEO/59]. Now Varda lifted up her hands from Mount Everwhite . A referent is identifiable when it is considered generally well-known or immediately unique (note that English often uses the article in such cases): imbi Menel Cemenye mene R\u00e1no tie [VT47/11]. Between Heaven and Earth goes the path of the Moon . R\u00e1no is not modified by the article, as the Moon is generally unique. man tiruva f\u00e1na cirya c\u00e1le fif\u00edrula? [MC/221]. Who shall heed a white ship while the light is fading? c\u00e1le is not modified by the article, as the light is a unique instance of a phenomenon for a given location. A referent is identifiable when it is a species or class in its entirety : eldar ataformaiti [VT49/7]. The Elves were ambidextrous . It is true for all elves, so the article is not needed. Note If a modifier limits the scope of the referent, the article might be used: zindar i\u00b7eldar Malariando [PE21/77]. Grey are the Elves of Beleriand . It is not implied to be true for all the elves in general. The article doesn\u2019t precede mass nouns and noun commonly used in plural: linte yuldar lisse-miruv\u00f3reva [RGEO/58]. Swift draughts of the sweet mead . man hlaruva ninqui carcar yarra [MC/221]. Who shall hear the white rocks snarling . A noun usually also doesn\u2019t have the article when it refers to an abstract concept : alcar Orom\u00e9va [WJ/369]. The splendor of Orome . Proper names rarely have an article, unless composed out of a single common noun : Arwen vanimelda, nam\u00e1rie [LotR/352]. Arwen beautiful and beloved, farewell . i\u00b7H\u00e9ru aselye [VT43/28]. The Lord is with thee . The article is not used with nouns modified by demonstrative and possessive pronouns , quantifiers , or determiner adjectives such as m\u00e9tima the last : vanda sina termaruva Elenna-n\u00f3reo alcar enyalien [UT/305]. This oath shall stand in memory of the glory of the Land of the Star . nai amanya onnalya ter coivierya [VT49/41]. May your child be blessed throughout his life . man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? [MC/222]. Who shall see the last evening? A predicative complement (\u2192 26.8-11 ) normally does not have the article, as it generally introduces new information. However, it has the article when it is identifiable for one of the reasons given above: n\u00e9se n\u00f3rima rocco [VT49/29]. He was a horse strong at running . mana i\u00b7coimas eldaron? [VT49/41]. What is the 'coimas' of the Eldar? coimas is conceptualized. Relative Position of Article, Head and Modifiers in a Noun Phrase Attributive and Predicative Position When the head of a noun phrase is modified by the article and one or more other modifiers (adjectives, pronouns, participles, \u2192 26.16-17 ), two different orderings of article, head and modifier can be distinguished: so-called attributive position (the modifier is between the article and the head): i m\u00e1ra n\u00e9r the good man ; so-called predicative position (the modifier is after the head, or before the article): i\u00b7n\u00e9r m\u00e1ra , m\u00e1ra i\u00b7n\u00e9r the man, being good, \u2026 (or: the man is good ). Note In poetry the distinction is not strict, and head-modifier order can be attributive: i\u00b7fairi n\u00e9ce ringa s\u00famaryasse [MC/221]. The pale phantoms in her cold bosom . Tip The general difference between attributive and predicative position may be described in the following way: a modifier in attributive position typically serves to identify the referent of the head noun (cf. e.g. En. the good man , as opposed to any other man); a modifier in predicative position is not used to identify the referent. Rather, adjectives and participles in predicative position say something about the condition the referent is in (cf. En. I drink my coffee black , They found the premises deserted ). The predicative position is always used for predicative complements with linking verbs \u2192 26.8-9 . However, there are various kinds of modifiers for which the distinction between the positions outlined above does not hold. These are treated below, \u2192 28.17-19 . Attributive Genitives I and II Most attributive genitives @@ can occur in both positions: valaron arcanwar , arcanwar valaron the trones of the Valar . Note The difference between the two constructions appears to be that in attributive position, the genitive I is presented as (more) vital for the identification of the head noun (for example, when the Valar are contrasted with another people, the attributive position will be used). But often the distinction is slight. In attributive position whether the head is definite of indefinite is undetermined, and the article modifies only the genitive: i\u00b7t\u00farin i\u00b7cormaron , i\u00b7cormaron t\u00farin the Lord of the Rings The rules of attributive genitive I above apply to attributive genitive II as well. However, it also can be treated as a quasi-adjective (for details, @@), not modified by the article, which then stands for the whole noun phrase: i\u00b7tyulma ciryava [PE21/80]. The mast of the ship . l\u00edrinen \u00f3mo i aire t\u00e1r\u00edva [PE17/76]. By the song of the voice of the holy queen . Note In each of these uses, modifiers in 'predicative' position actually do not have predicative function (for predicative function, \u2192 26.8-11 , 28.14 ). The terminology is therefore somewhat misleading, and should be taken to refer merely to word order. Pronominal Uses of the Article In a few highly specific uses the article has a pronominal function (i.e. serves as a noun phrase by itself, \u2192 26.15 ). The article can be used as a 3rd person object instead of se , sa (compare with English it and that ): v\u00e1 caris i [PE22/162]. He is not to do this . The article might be used as a relative pronoun in a common case : i\u00b7Eru i or ilye mahalmar ea tennoio [UT/305] The One who is above all thrones for ever . \u00c1taremma i ea h\u00b7an Ea [VT43/12] Our Father who art in Heaven . Or as a head of autonomous relative clause (for details, [REF]): l\u00e1 carita i hamil m\u00e1ra alasaila n\u00e1 [PE22/154]. Not to do what you judge good would be unwise .

In the overview below, the most important uses of each of the cases are listed, organized by syntactic function. The prepositions are treated separately, \u219231. Common The common case combines functions of historically separate nominative and accusative cases. As Nominative for Obligatory Constituent with Verbs The nominative is the case used for the subject of a finite verb (and any modifiers that agree with it, \u219227.7). Predicative complements with linking verbs (\u219226.8) agree with their subject (\u219227.7), and thus also stand in the nominative. Other Uses of Nominative The nominative is used with some most common prepositions as there default choice (\u219231). The nominative is also used in bare lists (\u219226.29), including entries in dictionaries. For the nominative used in apposition to a sentence , \u219227.14. The nominative is also used as a vocative : in calls or summonses to attract the attention of a person nearby, or of a god; in addresses, to acknowledge or maintain contact with some person nearby. Note When vocative stands in apposition to a noun, the case of that noun is applied, however. As Accusative for Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs) The accusative is the standard case for the direct object with verbs which take an object (\u219226.3). The following verbs (\u219226.12) take a direct object and a predicative complement that agrees with that object (and thus also stands in the accusative; this is often called a 'double accusative'). The accusative is also used in the accusative-and-infinitive (\u219251), the accusative absolute (\u219252) and accusative-and-participle constructions (\u219252). As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Time when , or within which , is expressed by either locative or accusative: umbe nin i hr\u00edve nauva urra si loa [PE22/168]. I have a feeling that winter will be bad this year. Accusative can also denote the spatial measure ( how long? how broad? ), especially with numerals: talion lempe halda n\u00e1 i\u00b7ando [translated; TAI/150]. Five foot high is the door . Apposition to a Sentence Tip When an appositive is added to an entire sentence or clause, it normally stands in the accusative (\u219227.14). Genitive The main function of the genitive is at the level of the noun phrase, to mark attributive modifiers (i.e. expressing various relations between (pro)nouns/noun phrases). It is also used to mark some required constituents (complements) with adjectives, and functions in a few adverbial expressions. Quenya distinguishes two genitival cases: genitive I or partitive and genitive II or adjective 1 . As Modifier in a Noun Phrase: the Attributive Genitive The genitive is used particularly within noun phrases, to mark a noun phrase or pronoun as modifier of a head (\u219226.18). Traditionally, many different categories within this attributive genitive use are distinguished; the most important of these are given below: The genitive of possession denotes ownership, belonging, etc.; The genitive of origin denotes the origin, offspring, source, etc. of the head; With nouns that express an action ('action nouns', \u219223.6), the genitive is used for the subject or object of that action \u2014 genitive of the subject (or 'subjective' genitive) or of the object (or 'objective' genitive); Other relations between nouns: material/contents, price/value, elaboration, etc. Genitive of possession distinguishes alienable (which can be given away or lost) and inalienable (perpetual and inherent to the head) possession. Concepts comprising inalienable possession include: body parts: r\u00e1mar aldaron , hon maro ; part-whole relations: tyulma ciryo , aicasse Taniquetildo ; kinship terms: amille Hristo , indis i\u00b7ciryamo ; various social relations: ingwe ingweron , aran zindaron ; attributes: Vorondo voronwe , alcar Orom\u00e8o ; products originating from the head: y\u00e1ve m\u00f3no , \u00f3ma t\u00e1rio . Generally these categories are expressed with genitive partitive , while the rest \u2014 alienable relations \u2014 with genitive adjective : Vardava tellumar , r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e9va . Genitive of origin marks the location where the modifier originated from, or its creator (who might not be in its possession), or its author: location: Calaciryo m\u00edri , Eldar Malariando ; creator: r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e8o , i\u00b7coimas Eldaron . Genitive of origin is expressed with genitive partitive , but its locational function is complementary to ablative , particularly if the noun phrase already has a modifier in genitive of another function: menelluin \u00cdrildeo Ondolindello . Genitive of composition describes the relation between two nouns as a part to its whole: material or substance: yuldar miruv\u00f3reo ; content: parma mittarion , aure veryanwesto ; individual elements: y\u00e9nion y\u00e9ni ; source: astali hruo . Genitive of subject , marked by genitive I, denotes the subject of a verbal noun: T\u00faro matie masta , nero carie cirya . Note that the action can sometimes be implicit: R\u00e1no tie path of the Moon ('path taken by the Moon'). Genitive of object (genitive II) describes the affected patient of the action: Nurtale Valin\u00f3reva , ciryava carie . Note that gerund can take a direct specific object in accusative like a verb. In that case, the object must follow 2 it: carie cirya making of a (specific) ship . Determiner Genitive and Descriptive Genitive While the functions listed above are useful, in practice they don't cover a multitude of border cases which we label here as descriptive . Most grammars treat it as a homogenous category with only vaguely defined function, but we can distinguish a few categories within it, responsible for naming , comparing and describing : Classifying genitives are used to name certain objects, where the dependent clearly restricts the denotation of the head noun: Nand' Gondoluncava , hwesta zindarinwa , Eruva lisse . Such genitive is semantically most closely related to adjectives and loose compounds: farea nasto , meneldea Eru , Ambarmetta , Elennan\u00f3re . Therefore it typically employs genitive II 3 . Metaphorical Genitive is used to describe an object, experience, state etc. in terms of another one: y\u00e9ni \u00fan\u00f3tim\u00eb ve r\u00e1mar aldaron . Structurally these genitives behave like determiner genitives from before, but the dependent is very clearly not specific. They do not have the function of a typical determiner (i.e. the referential anchoring of a referent), but rather, they evoke a certain typical property . In contrast to metaphorical genitives, generic genitives are not used to compare a referent in terms of another referent (or the referent\u2019s properties) but to describe a specific referent by setting it in relation to its kind : lambe Eldaron . Genitive II and Loose Compound Tip Essentially, adjective genitive only differs from N + N sequences in containing the marker -va . There are two main factors determining the presence or absence of -va in N + N sequences (given that both allow for a possessive construal), i.e. the animacy and the referentiality of the dependent. Adjective genitive still contains some degree of referentiality, in any case more than in expressions with loose compounding. For this reason, r\u00e1cina [arquenwa macil] is more likely to refer to a specific knight than r\u00e1cina [arquen macil] . Furthermore, animate dependents are usually realized with the -va , while inanimate dependents prefer the loose construction. In many cases. however, animacy does not determine categorically whether a genitive or an N + N sequence is used, but rather the statistical preference (i.e. frequency) of the two constructions. Genitive Gradience Gradience in grammar is usually characterized as the phenomenon of blurred boundaries between two categories. When it comes to genitive and the use of genitive I over genitive II, we distinguish two sources for gradience: gradience of the semantic features and gradience as a mismatch in the meaning\u2013form mapping. Gradience of the semantic features arises from natural ambiguity of some interpretations: Eldar Malariando the elves of (from) Beleriand [genitive of origin] and Eldar Malariand\u00e9va the Beleriand elves [classifying genitive] are for all purposes the same. The choice then comes as mostly esthetical, but some difference in meaning might still be implied: yuldar miruv\u00f3reo draughts (made) of mead [genitive of composition] and yuldar miruv\u00f3reva mead draughts, draughts sweet like mead [classifying or metaphorical genitive]. Mismatch mapping is a very late phenomenon when Quenya stopped being a colloquial language. It surfaced as a confusion between semantics of genitive I and II and consequent displacement of the latter. Tip As a rule of thumb if you are in an muddy case where it is difficult to decide between genitive I or II, consider whether a dependent is conveying a reference (genitive I) or describing a property (genitive II): octe porceo an egg of (a specific) chicken ; octe porceva a chicken egg (and not a duck egg) . As Obligatory Constituent With Adjectives The following adjectives (often related in meaning to the verbs regularly taking adverbial modifiers, especially with partitive sense) are complemented by a genitive: 'filled with', 'released from', 'free from', etc. The genitive of comparison is used to complement comparatives: arimelda na ilyaron [PE17/57]. She is dearest of all . For more details on comparatives and their constructions, \u219232. With Numerals From nelde three onwards, a preceding noun or noun phrase stand in genitive I plural: elenion nelde three stars . Note that in the late use it was substituted with accusative: eleni nelde three stars . For details on agreement of numerals, \u219226.TBD. As Predicative Complement or Prepositional Complement Many of the attributive uses of the genitive (\u219230.above) also occur as predicative complement with linking verbs. The genitive of quality , used to express a certain characteristic or manner of being, occurs exclusively in this way: neri \u00fa nati nostal\u00e8o mare [translated; PE15/32] 4 . Men are not beings good by nature . Similarly, attributive uses of the genitive may occur after certain prepositions (\u219231.8): Aina Wende mi Wenderon [VT44/12]. Holy Virgin of virgins . As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Sometimes verbs take genitive I in its partitive function to underline separation : verbs meaning 'remove from', 'rob of', 'free from' etc.: Varda ortane m\u00e1ryat Oiolosseo , lunces macilya vaileo 5 ; many verbs expressing sensorial or mental processes, to denote a source of stimulus: hlassenye\u00b7s Vardo 6 . Note To describe the direction , genitive is substituted with ablative : tentane Melcorello . Some verbs permit the genitive of cause to express the origin or reason for that action: s\u00edla R\u00e1no 7 . Dative The main function of the dative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers. It is also used to mark some required complements with verbs. Figure 30.1: Implication map: dative case of Quenya recipient : \u00e1men anta s\u00edra ilaurea massamma [VT43/12]. Give us this day our daily bread . benefactor : s\u00ed man i yulma nin enquantuva? [LotR/377]. Who now shall refill the cup for me? predicative possessor : umbe nin i hr\u00edve nauva urra [PE22/168]. I have a feeling that winter will be bad . experiencer : ece nin care sa [VT49/20]. Ece nin care sa . evaluator : i jarma \u00fa ten ulca s\u00edmaryassen [VT49/8]. The left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations . direction : mi cemen raine i h\u00ednin [VT44/34]. On earth peace, good will toward men . purpose : vanda sina termaruva Elenna\u00b7n\u00f3reo alcar enyalien [UT/305]. This oath shall stand in memory of the glory of the Land of the Star . As Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs) As Indirect Object The dative is used to express the indirect object or the recipient (Y) with the following types of verbs (X indicates a direct object in the common-accusative, where present): verbs meaning give , entrust , etc.; verbs meaning say , tell , report , etc. (usually with direct or indirect statement, \u219241.3); most verbs meaning command, order, advise etc. (usually together with an infinitive, \u219251.8); most verbs meaning seem , appear , etc. The dative as indirect object, or experiencer , complements the following impersonal verbs (\u219236.4-5), usually together with an infinitive (\u219251.8) (Y marks the dative): ece it is possible for Y (to do something); ola Y dreams (of something); h\u00b7ore Y feels an urge (to do something); moa 8 Y must (do something); nai it may chance for Y (to do something); Dative of the Possessor The dative of the possessor is used to complement 'existential' n\u00e1 and ea ( there is , \u219226.10), denoting possession, belonging, or interest. On the difference between this dative and verbs of possession ( same , harya , etc.), \u2192 TBD. As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Referring to Things or Abstract Entities The dative is very frequently used to express optional adverbial modifiers (\u219226.14). It marks nouns referring to things or abstract entities in various kinds of adverbial modifiers. The dative of cause expresses reason or cause. The bare dative of place may be used to express the direction whereto action takes place, as a short form of allative: lendes pallan i s\u00edr [PE17/65]. He came to a point far beyond the river . Referring to Persons The dative of advantage and dative of disadvantage are used to indicate the beneficiary (or opposite) of an action; they express in or against whose interest an action is performed: Ilu Il\u00favatar en c\u00e1re eldain a f\u00edrimoin [MQ: LR/63]. The Father made the World for Elves and Mortals . The dative also marks the person from whose perspective or vantage point the action is perceived: tulil m\u00e1rie nin [PE22/158]. You come happily for me . Instrumental The main function of the instrumental is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers. Figure 30.2: Implication map: instrumental case of Quenya 9 instrumental : antanenyes parmanen [PE17/91]. I presented him with a book . material : erulissenen quanta [VT43/26]. Filled with grace . manner : norne lintieryanen [PE17/58-59]. He ran as swiftly as he could . passive : tur\u00fan' ambartanen [UT/138]. By doom mastered . cause : Eru-indonen [PE22/165]. By the will of God . locative : tintilar i eleni l\u00edrinen [LotR/377]. The stars tremble in her voice . As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier) Instrumental case, as the name implies, most commonly marks the instrument or means by which an action is carried out: built with a hammer , painted with a brush , fought with fists . The instrumental of material is closely adjacent to it, and is used to complement transitive verbs and related adjectives to describe the material used in action: built with stone , rich with spoils , fraught with sorrows . Note the difference: filled with water (instrumental of material), but full of water (genitive of material). The instrumental of manner describes the manner in which an action was carried out, particularly with abstract nouns: carry with weariness , shine with golden light , give in measure 10 . The instrumental of agent is used in passive constructions to denote the agent of the action: executed by the king , heard by the audience , blamed by the wicked . While the instrumental of agent is usually employed for voluntary actions of animate nouns, similar instrumental of cause describes the circumstances in which an action happened, sometimes tangentially, and generally can be substituted in gloss with because of : disabled by a wound , bent with the sails 11 . The instrumental of location describes location or other intrinsic relations linked to the manner or source of an action, typically of intransitive verbs, and is generally translated with in, on : fall in the wind , cloack in veils , fluttering on the wings . Locative The main function of the locative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the scene of the action, generally pointing out where or when the action is happening. Spatial Locative The locative describes a general spatial relation. We can postulate the basing meaning as 12 : The figure is located close to the ground. The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use of specific spatial adpositions, like mi in or to on (\u2192 TBD), emphasizes the particulars of the relation and can highlight any deviations from the default assumption, thus serving to cancel unwarranted implicatures: a. The figure is in contact with the ground. b. The figure\u2013ground relation is canonical. c. The ground supports the figure against gravity. The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically: a plate is on a table rather than under it, while an apple is in a bowl rather than at it. To provide some examples: 1. the locative conveys the notion of being within a containment: i fairi n\u00e9ce ringa s\u00famaryasse ve maiwi yaimie [MC/222]. The pale phantoms in her cold bosom like gulls wailing . 2. it denotes a surface, trodden or touched: man tiruva r\u00e1cina cirya gondolisse morne? [MC/222]. Who shall heed a broken ship on the dark rocks? 3. it signifies the dominion or territory: Altariello nainie L\u00f3riendesse [RGEO/58]. Galadriel\u2019s lament in L\u00f3rien . 4. and the substance the locus is submerged into: nicsi coitar nenesse [PE22/125]. Fish live in water . Locative of Circumstance As the extenstion of this meaning, the locative often denotes the circumstances , under which the action comes to pass. This kind of locative encompasses the locative of time as well as the absolute locative (TBD). Locative of Time The locative of time refers to a specific moment or period: at which the event happens; by which the event should happen. qe e\u00b7k\u00e1rie i kirya aldaryas, ni kauva kiryasta menelyas [MQ: PE22/121]. If he finishes the boat by Tuesday , I shall be able to sail on Wednesday . Locative of Respect The locative of respect may denote the particular point of view from which a statement is made. This occurs chiefly with adjectives but also with intransitive verbs, and in gloss can be substituted with with regard to : i jarma \u00fa ten ulca s\u00edmaryassen [VT49/6]. the left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations . Such locative can be used for: parts of the body: pain in finger, blind in mind, smitten on the neck ; qualities and attributes (nature, form, size, name, birth, number, etc.): rival in appearance, two leagues in width ; sphere in general: terrible in battle, good in matters in which he is skilled . The instrumental of manner and genitive of quality are often nearly equivalent to the locative of respect: men are good in nature; men are good by nature; men are of good nature 13 . Locative of Manner With abstract nouns locative of manner can be used periphrasically to describe the state: hara m\u00e1riesse [PE17/162]. Stay in happiness (or: stay happily ) alalye nattira arcandemmar sangiessemman [VT44/8]. Despise not our petitions in our necessities (or: done out of necessity ). As Obligatory Complement Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in locative case: Heru \u00f3rava omesse [VT44/12]. Lord, have mercy on us . Allative The main function of the allative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the goal of the motion, generally pointing out whither . Figure 30.3: Implication map: allative case of Quenya As a Direction of Movement The allative describes a general directional goal of the movement. The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use with a specific spatial static adposition, like nu under (\u2192 TBD), emphasizes the particulars: lantaner Turcildi nuhuinenna [LR/47]. the Lordly Men fell under shadow . enwina l\u00fame elenillor pella talta-taltala [MC/222]. The old darkness beyond the stars falling . The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically, and a series of directional adpositions are used instead when the context is not complicit: unlunke naiqe yu vaile\u00b7na ar elle ha men ambostuva [EQ: PE16/146]. He pulled his sword from the sheath and drove it into the breast . To provide some canonic examples: 1. the allative describes the motion into a containment : eari ullier i kilyanna [LR/47]. The seas poured into the chasm . 2. it denotes a surface a movement is directed towards and comes into direct contact with: Anar caluva tielyanna [UT/22]. The sun shall shine upon your path . 3. it signifies entered dominion or territory : Et E\u00e4rello Endorenna ut\u00falien [LotR/967]. Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth have I come . 4. and generally the end point of a movement or intended destination : hr\u00edve \u00fava v\u00e9na [PE22/167]. Winter is drawing near to us . quiquie menin coaryanna, arse [VT49/24]. Whenever I arrive at his house, he is out . 5. as well as the target of aim : ar c\u00e9 mo formenna tentanes Amanna [VT49/8]. And if (one turned face) northwards, it (left hand) pointed towards Aman . Warning Allative profiles the goal as the intended destination , but it does not specify whether this goal is reached or whether an agent is somewhere on the way. However, if the direction is not the goal, the allative cannot be used. To describe the directionality of the path, the adposition na towards is employed instead 14 . Allative of Time In the domain of time, the use of the allative is restricted to those expressions where both the starting point and the endpoint are mentioned. For instance, if we want to say 'from Monday to Friday', we will use the allative as in izilyallo valanyanna , but if we just want to mention the endpoint, the use of the allative is not allowed; instead, the adposition tenna until is used. Therefore, until tomorrow is translated as tenna enar 16 . Allative of Purpose Assumption Extending the meaning of direction, allative also signifies the purpose of the action, following a frequent conceptualization: causes are origins of events , and purposes are destinations : let's go looking for food 15 . For the use of allative of purpose in periphrasic future construction \u2192 TBD. Allative as Translative Assumption Verbs of change like \u00f3la , verya , aja take allative to describe a final state or result : he turned into a great scholar . Allative of Extent Similar to instrumental, allative can describe how an action was carried out, answering a question to what extent? to what degree? a laita t\u00e1rienna [LotR/953]. Praise (them) to the height . As Obligatory Complement As Direct Object Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in allative case: verya senna [VT49/45]. I married her . Tar-Calion octac\u00e1re Valannar [LR/47]. Tar-Kalion warred the Powers . As Indirect Object Generally, dative denoting a recipient can be freely substituted for allative: antane ninna [PE17/147]. He gave it to me . sin quent\u00eb Quendingoldo Elendilenna [PM/401]. Thus Pengolodh said to Elendil . Ablative The main function of the ablative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the source of the motion, generally pointing out whence , and is therefore the very opposite of allative . As a Direction of Movement The ablative, then, is wanted to express from what place there is a starting and moving: in its proper sense, movement away from : m\u00e9tima hrestallo c\u00edra leave the last shore [MC/221]; movement out of a container, often accompanied with a preposition et : Melko Mardello lende Melko has gone from Earth [MQ: LR/72] et E\u00e4rello Endorenna ut\u00falien out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I have come [LotR/967]; starting point of movement: elenillor pella talta-taltala beyond stars falling [MC/222] pointing, aiming away from: i hyarma tentane Melkorello the left hand pointed away from Melkor [VT49/6]; Assumption moving off a surface; to see, hear, speak etc from a spot; Warning Verbs of separation from the whole take genitive I: n\u00b7alalmino hy\u00e1 lanta lasse from the elm-tree here a leaf falls [EQ:VT40/8]. Ablative of Source, Origin and Cause In a more abstract sense with verbs of: taking, receiving from : yello camnelyes from whom you received him [VT47/21]; protecting, guarding, securing from : \u00e1me etelehta ulcullo deliver us from evil [VT43/12]; being afraid of [VT44/7]; Assumption asking, wishing, learning from ; restraining, preventing, excluding from ; Note Ablative of origin can also be used as an attributive modifier: Menelluin \u00cdrildeo Gondolindello Cornflower of Idril from Gondolin [TAI/193], fanwen tollillon l\u00f3mealloi a dream from the gloomy islands [PE16/147]. Genitive I is more common in this role, however. Assumption From a common interpretation causes are origins of events arises the ablative of cause, describing the cause, reason, motive by which an action or an event came to be 17 . Ablative of Time When denoting time, the ablative carries the meaning of from, since, after . Commonly it is attended by prepositions, as et : et sillumello ter y\u00e9nion y\u00e9ni tenn' ambarmetta from this hour, through years of years until the ending of the world [VT44/33], but it is possible to go with single ablative 18 . Ablative as Exessive Assumption As the opposite of translative, exessive denotes the former state or shape , out of which some other state or shape proceeds or is produced. As Obligatory Complement As Indirect Object A few special verbs take second (indirect) object in ablative: \u00e1vatyara mello roctammar [VT43/11]. Forgive us our trespasses .

Traditionally, many different categories within this attributive genitive use are distinguished; the most important of these are given below: The genitive of possession denotes ownership, belonging, etc.; The genitive of origin denotes the origin, offspring, source, etc. of the head; With nouns that express an action ('action nouns', \u219223.6), the genitive is used for the subject or object of that action \u2014 genitive of the subject (or 'subjective' genitive) or of the object (or 'objective' genitive); Other relations between nouns: material/contents, price/value, elaboration, etc. Genitive of possession distinguishes alienable (which can be given away or lost) and inalienable (perpetual and inherent to the head) possession. Concepts comprising inalienable possession include: body parts: r\u00e1mar aldaron , hon maro ; part-whole relations: tyulma ciryo , aicasse Taniquetildo ; kinship terms: amille Hristo , indis i\u00b7ciryamo ; various social relations: ingwe ingweron , aran zindaron ; attributes: Vorondo voronwe , alcar Orom\u00e8o ; products originating from the head: y\u00e1ve m\u00f3no , \u00f3ma t\u00e1rio . Generally these categories are expressed with genitive partitive , while the rest \u2014 alienable relations \u2014 with genitive adjective : Vardava tellumar , r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e9va . Genitive of origin marks the location where the modifier originated from, or its creator (who might not be in its possession), or its author: location: Calaciryo m\u00edri , Eldar Malariando ; creator: r\u00f3ma Orom\u00e8o , i\u00b7coimas Eldaron . Genitive of origin is expressed with genitive partitive , but its locational function is complementary to ablative , particularly if the noun phrase already has a modifier in genitive of another function: menelluin \u00cdrildeo Ondolindello . Genitive of composition describes the relation between two nouns as a part to its whole: material or substance: yuldar miruv\u00f3reo ; content: parma mittarion , aure veryanwesto ; individual elements: y\u00e9nion y\u00e9ni ; source: astali hruo . Genitive of subject , marked by genitive I, denotes the subject of a verbal noun: T\u00faro matie masta , nero carie cirya . Note that the action can sometimes be implicit: R\u00e1no tie path of the Moon ('path taken by the Moon'). Genitive of object (genitive II) describes the affected patient of the action: Nurtale Valin\u00f3reva , ciryava carie . Note that gerund can take a direct specific object in accusative like a verb.

Most grammars treat it as a homogenous category with only vaguely defined function, but we can distinguish a few categories within it, responsible for naming , comparing and describing : Classifying genitives are used to name certain objects, where the dependent clearly restricts the denotation of the head noun: Nand' Gondoluncava , hwesta zindarinwa , Eruva lisse . Such genitive is semantically most closely related to adjectives and loose compounds: farea nasto , meneldea Eru , Ambarmetta , Elennan\u00f3re . Therefore it typically employs genitive II 3 . Metaphorical Genitive is used to describe an object, experience, state etc. in terms of another one: y\u00e9ni \u00fan\u00f3tim\u00eb ve r\u00e1mar aldaron . Structurally these genitives behave like determiner genitives from before, but the dependent is very clearly not specific. They do not have the function of a typical determiner (i.e. the referential anchoring of a referent), but rather, they evoke a certain typical property . In contrast to metaphorical genitives, generic genitives are not used to compare a referent in terms of another referent (or the referent\u2019s properties) but to describe a specific referent by setting it in relation to its kind : lambe Eldaron .","title":"Determiner Genitive and Descriptive Genitive"},{"location":"syntx/cas/#genitive-ii-and-loose-compound","text":"Tip Essentially, adjective genitive only differs from N + N sequences in containing the marker -va . There are two main factors determining the presence or absence of -va in N + N sequences (given that both allow for a possessive construal), i.e. the animacy and the referentiality of the dependent. Adjective genitive still contains some degree of referentiality, in any case more than in expressions with loose compounding. For this reason, r\u00e1cina [arquenwa macil] is more likely to refer to a specific knight than r\u00e1cina [arquen macil] . Furthermore, animate dependents are usually realized with the -va , while inanimate dependents prefer the loose construction. In many cases. however, animacy does not determine categorically whether a genitive or an N + N sequence is used, but rather the statistical preference (i.e. frequency) of the two constructions.","title":"Genitive II and Loose Compound"},{"location":"syntx/cas/#genitive-gradience","text":"Gradience in grammar is usually characterized as the phenomenon of blurred boundaries between two categories. When it comes to genitive and the use of genitive I over genitive II, we distinguish two sources for gradience: gradience of the semantic features and gradience as a mismatch in the meaning\u2013form mapping. Gradience of the semantic features arises from natural ambiguity of some interpretations: Eldar Malariando the elves of (from) Beleriand [genitive of origin] and Eldar Malariand\u00e9va the Beleriand elves [classifying genitive] are for all purposes the same.

Mismatch mapping is a very late phenomenon when Quenya stopped being a colloquial language. It surfaced as a confusion between semantics of genitive I and II and consequent displacement of the latter.

A significant overhaul of the chapter should be expected. Pronouns and Quantifiers Personal Pronouns Accented and Non-Accented Personal Pronouns Personal pronouns are used only pronominally (\u219226.22-3). They are either accented ( stressed and emphatic ) or non-accented (for details, \u21927.1-2): to an extent, this distinction corresponds to a contrastive and a non-contrastive function. When describing the subject, and no (contrastive) emphasis is needed, the personal endings of the verb suffice. The unaccented pronouns are then only used in oblique cases . c\u00e9 tulis, tanome nauvan [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . No emphasis on the subject. nai lye hiruva airea Amanar [AUCT-LET/1963-12-18]. May thee find a blessed Yule . Unaccented pronoun in oblique case. Contrast signals to a listener that the utterance should be taken as one of several alternatives. Depending on their importance, contrast might be exhaustive or uncertain . Exhaustive is contrast where all relevant alternatives are covered, either explicitly in several clauses, or implicitly with entity present in the context: inye t\u00fale, apa isse \u00fane [\u2014]. I came, but HE didn\u2019t . All other alternatives (e.g. me not coming, or him coming) are explicitly dismissed. nai elye hiruva [LotR/378]. Maybe THOU shalt find it . Galadriel implicitly contrasts herself to Frodo, expecting never to come back to Valimar herself. Alternatives of exhaustive contrast are generally mutually exclusive. With an uncertain contrast the speaker is only making a claim about the referent of the pronoun and leaves it open whether this claim should or should not apply to the other referents relevant in the discourse: c\u00e9 tulis, n\u00ed nauva tanome [VT49/19]. If he comes, I will be there . Whether anyone else will be there is left on the table. Unlike alternatives of exhaustive contrast, here they don\u2019t need to be exclusive. Another factor is focality . Some of the typical cases include clefts, answers to wh-questions, comparative constructions, focus constructions, etc: melinye s\u00e9 apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love HIM , but not HIM . The answer to a question: ' Whom do you love?' Main purpose of an accented pronoun in such position is to identify a referent as one of several alternatives, or to exhaust the set by dismissing all other alternatives: aistana elye im\u00edca n\u00edsi [VT43/28]. Blessed art THOU amongst women . Exhaustive pronoun implies that only Mary is considered. Tip The difference between stressed and emphatic pronouns then comes to differentiate between these two classes of contrast. Exhaustive contrast is denoted by emphatic pronouns, often appended in translation to English with only or even . Stressed pronouns are used then for weak, identifying contrast. However, this distinction does not always hold. First and Second Person First-person pronoun refers to a speaker, and in addition to number and accent distinguishes clusivity: listener can be either involved ( inclusive 'we') or specifically excepted ( exclusive 'we') from the context. unaccented stressed emphatic sg. ni n\u00ed inye pl. incl. we w\u00e9 elwe pl. excl. me m\u00e9 elme d. incl. wet w\u00e9t inque d. excl. met m\u00e9t emme Second-person pronoun refers to a listener, and has different levels of formality: unaccented stressed emphatic sg. familiar tye ty\u00e9 itye sg. formal lye ly\u00e9 elye pl. le l\u00e9 elde d. lyet ly\u00e9t este Note In colloquial speech, particularly of Men, plural exclusive form was sometimes used for first person plural in general. This was considered incorrect by Ngoldor 1 . Later, except for colloquial speech, familiar tye was eventually displaced by lye . To denote respect tar sir, madam could be used instead 2 . Third and Fourth Person Third- and fourth-person pronouns refer to an entity other than a speaker or a listener. To alleviate the ambiguity between several actors within the same phrase, first actor is marked as third-person, and the following as fourth: s\u00e9 ringane h\u00e9, ar h\u00e9 runce [modified VT49/15]. He struck him , and he fled . There is no ambiguity, as there would be in English. Third and fourth person distinguish animate and inanimate gender. Distinction is semantic: animates are noun capable to act on their own volition (including trees and plants), and inanimates are the rest (including abstract concepts). third-person pronouns: unaccented stressed emphatic sg. anim. se s\u00e9 isse pl. anim. te t\u00e9 inte sg. inanim. sa s\u00e1 issa pl. inanim. ta(i) t\u00e1 inta d. tu t\u00fa itte fourth-person pronouns (only singular): unaccented stressed emphatic sg. anim. je j\u00e9 ecse sg. inanim. ja j\u00e1 ecsa Reflexive Pronouns and Other Reflexive Expressions Introduction; Pronouns Used as Reflexives; Direct and Indirect Reflexives Reflexivity is the phenomenon whereby a pronoun is used to 'reflect' (i.e. refer back or forwards to) another constituent of the sentence or clause, nearly always the subject: an c\u00e9 mo querne immo n\u00famenna [draft VT49/6]. For if one turned oneself westward . A distinction is made between: direct reflexivity : pronouns which refer back to an element within the same clause/construction; indirect reflexivity : pronouns in a subordinate construction (subordinate clauses, infinitive or participle constructions), which refer back to an element in the main/matrix clause (for subordination, \u219239.2, 39.5): Elerondo quente insen Elrond said to himself . Direct reflexive: inse is the indirect object of quente , and refers to its subject. Elerondo hlasse sa Elessar quente sen Elrond heard what Aragorn told him . Indirect reflexive: sen refers back to the subject of hlasse , but syntactically is a part of the dependent clause. Tip Like English, Quenya doesn't use reflexive pronouns with introverted actions unlike many other languages, preferring bare intransitive verbs. Typical extroverted verbs are transitive verbs like 'kill', 'hate', 'criticize', 'see', 'attack', and typical introverted verbs are verbs like 'wash', 'shave', 'dress', 'defend'. Some introverted actions might be expressed by the mediopassive voice, but only with certain verbs ('verbs of grooming', \u219235.11). Extroverted actions always require a pronoun. The following pronouns are used in reflexive constructions: the reflexive pronoun ( imne , imule , inse , etc., \u21927.3); (oblique cases of) the personal pronoun ( ni , lye, se`, etc., \u21927.2); reflexive inflection. Note A distinction should thus be maintained between 'reflexive pronouns' (a morphological category, referring to a specific type of pronoun, inse , etc.) and 'pronouns used in reflexive constructions' (a syntactic phenomenon). While reflexive pronouns always express reflexivity, reflexivity is not always necessarily marked by the use of a reflexive pronoun. To-Do Go through PE22/94 in case there are some missed details. Pronouns Used as Direct and Indirect Reflexives Obviation In many (or perhaps most) languages, nonsubject anaphoric personal pronouns are obviative , i.e. they cannot be coreferential with a coargument: The dogs 1 bit them 2/*1 . Quenya, however, has three types of third person anaphoric pronouns: an obviative nonreflexive pronoun je , a nonobviative nonreflexive pronun se , and a reflexive pronoun inse : 3 Zindacollo 1 tatalla je 2 / se 1/2 / inse 1 . Thingol admires him 2 / him(self) 1/2 / himself 1 . Note how the use of se can be ambiguous. Direct Reflexivity In the direct reflexive use, the reflexive pronoun is normally required, particularly for emphasis (\u219229.2-5) or to distinguish from reciprocal use of personal pronoun (\u219229.14). Arwen cenne inse i\u00b7cilintilasse Arwen saw herself in the mirror . However, personal pronouns can be used as direct reflexives, especially in the first and second person, and in poetry much more freely than in prose. ni\u00b7c\u00faven I hid myself . If the third person is implicit , verb receives a reflexive ending: melisse / melitte [VT49/21]. He loves himself / they love themselves . Indirect Reflexivity In indirect reflexive context, the nonobviative nonrelexive pronouns are used (reflexive pronoun is bound locally ): Arcimbelenna leltani\u00e9la h\u00b7oraneltet roccor t\u00e9na ta rimba ve c\u00e1rima tulta They 1 sent to Rivendell and asked that they 2 send them 1/3 as many horses as possible . t\u00e9na refers back to the subject of h\u00b7oraneltet (1), though obviative interpretation (3) is possible. inte could only refer to the subject of infinitive clause (2). Possessive Pronouns and Other Expressions of Possession Quenya uses the following pronominal constructions to express possession, belonging, descent, origin, etc.: possessive suffixes, \u21927.7; possessive pronouns ( ninya , lelya , s\u00e9va , etc., \u21927.8). Separate possessive pronouns may be used pronominally or adnominally. In the latter case, they are normally used for emphasis (\u219229.2-5), and in poetry much more freely than in prose: nan \u00faye s\u00e9re indo-ninya s\u00edmen, ullume [LR/72]. But my heart resteth not here for ever . \u00e1vatyara mello menye roctar [draft; VT43/11]. Forgive us our trespasses . Reciprocal Pronouns The reciprocal construction expresses the idea that two or more persons are simultaneously involved in one and the same action, like English each other , one another . Reciprocal actions can be expressed in Quenya by the preverb o\u00b7 with (e.g. o\u00b7mennente they met each other ), by the personal pronoun ( te palpanente they hit each other ) and by the repetition of cognates: m\u00e1 sove m\u00e1 Hands wash each other . Demonstrative Pronouns Pointing Outside or Inside the Text Demonstratives have a pointing or deictic function. They may either point to someone/thing in the world outside the text , or to a single word or larger segment of the text itself . Telperinquar Erciandello tence sine tenguar [translated; LotR/305]. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs . sine refers to the signs actually present on the door, \u2192 we might imagine Celebrimbor pointing at them. lende tanna Nieliccelis, sana wende nieninquea [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le, that maiden like a snowdrop . The pronoun refers to element in the text, anaphorically to Ni\u00e9le. When pointing outside of the text, demonstratives distinguish between proximal sina this by me , medial tana that by you , and distal enta yonder : sina refers to something immediately near to the speaker (physically or mentally); tana refers to something within the reach of the speaker and/or addressee (physically or mentally), but not specifically near to the speaker; enta refers to something beyond the reach of the speaker and addressee (physically or mentally). When a demonstrative refers to an element in the text itself it may refer backward to something introduced before (anaphoric use) or point forward in the text to something about to be introduced (cataphoric use): sina or enta normally serve to announce something that will follow immediately, or refer to something prominent in the speaker's mind; sana is used most often to refer to something mentioned previously; to refer to something which has not been mentioned for a while (or to pick up something which was mentioned before a form of sana or sina 'intervened') a form of yana former must be used instead. Further Particulars Forms of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs usually have short and long forms (\u21927.18). The long demonstrative nearly always carries heavier stress: sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn' Ambarmetta [LotR/967]. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world . umbe nin i hr\u00edve nauva urra si loa [PE22/168]. I have a feeling that winter will be bad this year . Sentential Pronouns While personal pronouns refer to specific words or noun phrases (or constructions operating as noun phrases), sometimes we might need to mention a larger segment of a conversation instead, a clause or a sequence of clauses. Alongside demonstrative pronouns, Quenya has two additional sentential pronouns for this case \u2014 subjective ha and objective sa (similar to sana , \u219229.14): y\u00e1ra T\u00faro mante ilqua masta, ha m\u00e9\u00b7ne \u00famactale [PE22/119]. Old Turo ate all the bread, that was a nuisance to us . Pronoun ha means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'. y\u00e1ra T\u00faro mante ilqua masta. M\u00e9\u00b7l\u00e1ner fasta sa [modified; PE22/119]. Old Turo ate all the bread. We were not pleased with that . Pronoun sa means 'the fact that old Turo ate all the bread'. Indefinite Pronouns The indefinite pronouns refer to someone or something that is not immediately identifiable. They can appear in the varying contexts, some of which include: When the speaker does not wish to reveal , or pay attention to, the identity of a specific individual: n\u00e1mo tule, intya man Someone came, guess who . When referring to individuals whose specific identity is unknown or irrelevant : hlassen ma, mal \u00fa istan manima I heard something, but I don't know of what sort . When referring to something non-specific or non-existing : neve ma h\u00b7ecsa, mecin Please, try something else 4 . In comparison , condition and possibility : n\u00e1se halda l\u00e1 aiquen He is taller than anyone ; c\u00e9 cenil aiquen, quet\u00e1 nin Shall you see anyone, tell me ; lertal mique aiquen You may kiss anyone . In negation and polar question : \u00fa cennen \u00faquen I haven't seen anyone ; \u00fa novin i \u00faquen tuluva I don't think anyone will come ; ma \u00faquen quente lyen \u00faqua p\u00e1\u00b7sa? Has anyone told you anything about that? The summary of these functions is shown on the chart: Figure 29.1: Implication map: indefinite pronouns of Quenya There are also groups of indefinite adjectives and adverbs which form related series with indefinite pronouns (\u21927.14). Their functions are crudely summarized in the table: na-series bare m-series ai/qui-series \u00fa-series person n\u00e1mo 5 quen mo aiquen \u00faquen thing nat qua ma aiqua \u00faqua location nanome nome \u2014 quinome \u00fanome time nalume lume \u2014 quie \u00falume Generic Pronouns The pronoun mo is used as a generic pronoun in: generalized statements of speaker\u2019s experiences and expectations: matie telumbi sine c\u00e9 nace mo One can die from eating these mushrooms . advises and instructions which should affect the listener's practical reasoning: alasaila n\u00e1 l\u00e1 care tai mo nave m\u00e1ra [PE22/154]. It is unwise not to do what one judges good . putting a speaker into the other person's situation in conditional statement: c\u00e9 mo querne cendele n\u00famenna, i\u00b7jarma tentane Melcorello [VT49/8]. If one turned the face westward, the left hand pointed away from Melkor . in sayings and aphorisms: mo \u00fa coita rie massenen You cannot live on bread alone . Note On impersonal constructions of exclusive generic statement (cf. E. they ), \u219236.14. In colloquial speech mo can generally be replaced with inclusive 'we'. Tip The generic pronoun ma one, thing can be used as a generic they when referring to classes of things: moa nin cirma; masse hepilye ma? I need a knife. Where do you keep them? Interrogative Pronouns For the use of interrogative pronouns man who? , mana what? in direct and indirect questions, \u219238.11-14 and 42.5-6. Relative Pronouns For the use of relative pronouns, \u219250.8-16. Quantifiers ilya The quantifier ilya in the singular means each, every . In the plural, it means all : ilya osto each/every city (sometimes: an entire city ) ilye ostor all the cities The corresponding universal pronouns are ilquen everyone and illi all . quana The quantifier quana 6 means whole, entire : tir\u00e1 quana tama Look at the entire matter . er er means by itself, alone, the only : er hinyan na anta i\u00b7r\u00ede To my only child shall be given a crown . enta and jana The basic meaning of enta is other (out of many) , stressing similarity . The basic meaning of jana is other (than something else) , stressing difference : \u00f3lamar ar ente l\u00e1mar consonants and other sounds ; \u00f3lamar jane l\u00e1mar l\u00e1 \u00f3mar connsonants are different sounds than vowels . Indefinite Marker as Quantifier In many cases the indefinite marker (\u21924.7) can be translated to English with quantifier some . When it stands with the article it means many : i\u00b7falmalinnar imbe met [LotR/377]. Upon the many foaming waves between us two . When modified by a quantifier n\u00f3tima it means (a) few : cennen n\u00f3time eldali [PE22/155]. I saw a few Elves .

Most of the examples are taken from the Late Quenya corpus, but if the example was adapted from earlier materials, the reference has an additional remark. Chapters 40 to 52 deal with the various types of subordinate constructions found in complex sentences (subordinate clauses, participles, and infinitives): these will be separately introduced in chapter 39. The Sentence Core Predicate, Subject, Object, Complement Most sentences (for the exceptions, \u2192 26.12 ) contain at least a predicate (nearly always a finite verb) and one or more obligatory constituents that belong to that predicate; together these make up the sentence core . Nearly all verbs take at least one obligatory constituent, a subject . Subjects are marked by the common case (\u2192@@), and predicates agree with it in number (\u2192 27.1 ). Some verbs take only a subject: tintilar predicate i\u00b7eleni subject [RGEO/58]. The stars twinkle . i\u00b7arcanwar subject tauvar predicate [PE22/147]. The thrones endure . ulo subject \u00fava predicate [PE22/167]. The rain is coming . Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the direct object , which is also marked by the common case (\u2192@@); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called complements ): Varda subject m\u00e1ryat object ortane predicate [LotR/377]. Varda has uplifted her hands . ilye tier object undul\u00e1ve predicate lumbule subject [LotR/377]. All paths are drowned deep in shadows . ort\u00edrielyanna complement rucimme predicate [VT44/5]. We fly to thy patronage . i\u00b7jarma subject tentane predicate Melcorello object [VT49/7]. The left hand pointed away from Melkor . Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object , which is marked by the dative case (\u2192@@); other verbs take a second complement in the common case: Varda subject enquantuva predicate i\u00b7yulma object nin indirect object [VT49/7]. Varda will fill the cup for me . l\u00e1 navin predicate caritalya\u00b7s object m\u00e1ra complement [PE22/154]. I don't advise you to do so . In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, \u2192 26.15-20 ). Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are: prepositional phrases (consisting of a preposition and its complement): i subject or ilye mahalmar complement ea predicate [UT/305]. Who is above all thrones . adverbs : lende predicate tanna complement Nieliccilis subject [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le . subordinate clauses : savin predicate i Elessarno quetie naite object [PE22/158]. I believe that the words of Aragorn are true . The declarative subordinate clause (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate savin : compare Elessar in savin Elessar 'I believe Aragorn' . infinitive constructions : man subject cenuva predicate f\u00e1na cirya c\u00edra object [MC/221]. Who shall see a white ship leave . The common-and-infinitive construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate cenuva : compare and\u00fane in man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? 'Who shall see the last evening?' participle constructions : lie subject tatallaner predicate i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina object [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The common-and-participle construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate tatallaner : compare i\u00b7m\u00e1r in tatallanen i\u00b7m\u00e1r 'I marveled at the house' . When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a complex sentence . For complex sentences, \u2192@@. Note The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus fir\u00eb die has a valency of one, anta give has a valency of three. Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb cir\u00eb , when it takes only a subject, means sail , but may also take an object and then means cut . The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence. It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as tanna in (11) , and with verbs which may have different valencies. In reality, syntactic 'obligatoriness' is better seen as a scale, with constituents being more or less obligatory depending on the verb and construction used. There are a few verbs which do not have a subject ('impersonal' verbs, \u2192@@), and very few of these take no other obligatory constituents (i.e. have a valency of zero). The sentence core then consists of nothing but the verb: e.g. \u00fala it is raining . 'Omission' of the Subject and Other Constituents That a verb takes a certain number of obligatory constituents does not mean that all those constituents are necessarily expressed every single time that verb is used. A constituent may be omitted if it is sufficiently clear from the context who or what is meant: roccor i\u00b7Erulingaron m\u00e1re n\u00e1r? N\u00e1r [PE22/166]. The horses of Rohirrim are good, are they not? They are . The second sentence has no explicit subject \u2014 'horses' has been the subject of the previous sentence and need not be mentioned explicitly again. Note that these constituents have to be supplied in translation ('they'). savin Elessar ar i n\u00e1ne aran Ond\u00f3reo [PE22/158]. I believe Aragorn, and that he was a King of Gondor . Elessar doesn\u2019t need to be mentioned explicitly again. \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende [PE22/166]. Close the door . English, too, normally omits the subject with imperatives. h\u00b7ore nin carita\u00b7s n\u00f3 namin alasaila [VT41/13]. I would like to do so but judge it unwise . Note how the second sentence has no explicit object, added in the translation ('it') 1 . The lack of an explicit, separately expressed subject is particularly frequent in Quenya, and constitutes a regular feature of the language. Information about the subject of a verb is then usually expressed by the personal ending of that verb: merin sa h\u00b7aryalye galasse n\u00f3 vanyalye Ambarello [MS/1]. I hope that you have happiness before you pass from the world . The subjects ('I', 'you') are expressed by the first- and second-person singular endings. melinye\u00b7s apa l\u00e1 h\u00e9 [VT49/15]. I love him but not him (the other) . The subjects ('I') is expressed by the first-person singular ending, while the first object ('him') by singular object clitic. In the third person, the omission of the subject is regular if the subject of the previous sentence is continued, as in (15) . If the subject changes, an explicitly expressed subject is normally required [VT49/14-15]. In the first and second person, explicitly expressed subjects (in the form of the personal pronouns n\u00ed , ly\u00e9 , etc.) are used only for emphasis or contrast. For such 'contrastive' pronouns, \u2192@@. Note The omission of other elements than the subject (such as the object in (18) ) is much more restricted and infrequent than the lack of an explicitly expressed subject. The object can be substituted for a short clitic form which closely follows the verb (20) in third person only. Linking Verb, Predicative Complement A linking verb (or copulative / copular verb , copula ) 'links' a subject to a nominal constituent, the so-called predicative complement , which identifies the subject or assigns a property to it. The predicative complement is usually an adjective which agrees in case and number with the subject, or a noun which agrees with the subject in case (\u2192 27.7 , @@). Examples of verbs that can function as linking verbs are na be , ol\u00eb become , lar\u00eb remain, stay , nem\u00eb seem, appear to be, prove to be , etc. [ vanwa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb ] predicate Valimar subject [LotR/377]. Lost is Valimar . [ n\u00e9se linking verb n\u00f3rima rocco predicative noun phrase ] predicate [VT49/29]. He was a horse strong at running . Note Predicative nouns or adjectives are sometimes called 'predicate nouns/adjectives'. Predicative complements agreeing with a subject are also sometimes called 'subject(ive) complements'. Linking verbs also occur with an adverbial expression of place or circumstance as their complement: e.g. n\u00e1 be (somewhere), find oneself (somewhere) . But normally special verbs of position are used instead: tul\u00eb get somewhere , har\u00eb stay somewhere . In many grammatical treatments, such complements are also seen as predicative complements: n\u00ed subject [ nauva linking verb tanome complement ] predicate [VT49/19]. I will be there . The verb n\u00e1 , unlike its English counterpart, doesn\u2019t occur in the meaning exist . An expression like tasse n\u00e1 'there is' can have only contrastive meaning 'but not here'. In the ' existential ' use, the verb ea with only a subject is used instead. The verb tule also has an existential use, and then means happen : vahaia n\u00f3re subject ea predicate i ga\u00b7esta Valinor [ MQ : PE22/124]. Far a way there is a land called Valinor . Some other verbs link an object to a predicative complement that agrees with that object (both are in the common). Examples of such verbs are consider X (to be) Y, make X Y, appoint X as Y (for more details, \u2192@@): alasaila n\u00e1 l\u00e1 care tai object mo subject [ nave verb m\u00e1ra predicative adjective ] predicate [PE22/154]. It is unwise not to do what one judges good . Note Predicative complements agreeing with an object are sometimes called 'object(ive) complements'. Omission of a Linking Verb: Nominal Sentences Frequently, a linking verb such as na is lacking in a sentence, whose core then contains only nominal elements. This occurs especially in the following cases: when predicative adjective follows the subject: i\u00b7roccor subject rindi predicate [ MQ : PE21/78]. The horses are swift . Elessarno quetie subject naite predicate [PE22/158]. The words of Aragorn are true . Unless the subject is not expressed, or is separated from a predicate: y\u00e1 hr\u00edve mene, ringa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb [VT49/23]. When winter comes, it is cold . Impersonal use (lit. 'cold is'); for this, \u2192@@. vanwa predicative adjective n\u00e1 linking verb , R\u00f3mello vanwa, Valimar subject ! [LotR/377]. Lost, lost to those from the east is Valimar! if the subject is postponed, but is separated from a predicate with a definite article: mana predicate i\u00b7coimas Eldaron subject [PM/395]. What is the 'coimas' of the Eldar? aistana predicate i\u00b7y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo subject [VT43/31]. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb . with explicit pronouns: aistana predicate elye subject im\u00edca n\u00edsi [VT43/28]. Blessed art thou amongst women . with adverbs of position and direction: tasse i\u00b7osto [ MQ : PE22/124]. There is the city . manna l\u00e9 sinnar [ MQ : PE22/124]. Where are you going this morning? with prepositional phrases: i\u00b7H\u00e9ru as\u00b7elye prepositional phrase [VT43/28]. The Lord is with thee . quiquie menin coaryanna, ar\u00b7se prepositional phrase [VT49/23]. Whenever I get to his house, he is out . in formulaic questions: ma naite? [PE22/166]. Is it true? Only the present indicative of na be is regularly omitted as linking verb in this way: other forms such as imperfect n\u00e1ne or future nauva are not normally omitted, unless other indications of time are present, especially in expressions of location or direction of movement: masse l\u00e9 enar? [ MQ : PE22/124]. Where will you be tomorrow? Optional Constituents Adverbial Modifiers and Other Optional Constituents Many core sentences are elaborated by one or more optional ( non-obligatory ) constituents, which can be left out without making the sentence ungrammatical, and which supplement the sentence core in various ways. Most often such constituents are adverbial modifiers . Such optional constituents can be expressed by: adverbs : tas cennen n\u00f3time eldali [PE22/155]. I saw a few elves there . Adverbial modifier of place. noun phrases and pronouns (in the common, dative or adverbial case, \u2192@@): \u00e1\u00b7men anta s\u00edra ilaurea massamma [VT43/12]. Give us this day our daily bread . Adverbial modifier of time, expressed by the common, \u2192@@. s\u00ed man i\u00b7yulma nin enquantuva? [LotR/377]. Who now shall refill the cup for me? Constituent representing the beneficiary/interested party, expressed by the dative, \u2192@@. Such constituents are often taken as indirect objects, but unlike indirect objects with verbs of giving, etc. (for which \u2192 26.3 ), they are optional. prepositional phrases : nai amanya onnalya ter coivierya [VT49/41]. May your child be blessed throughout their life . Adverbial modifier of time. And in the case of complex sentences, by: subordinate clauses : y\u00e1 hr\u00edve mene, ringa n\u00e1 [VT49/23]. When winter comes, it is cold . The temporal subordinate clause (\u2192@@) serves as an adverbial modifier of time. participle constructions (also \u2192 26.22 ): man tiruva f\u00e1na cirya gear falastala [MC/222]. Who shall heed a white ship, while the sea is surging . The common absolute construction serves as an adverbial modifier of time. Adverbial modifiers operate on different 'levels' of the sentence: The adverbial modifiers in examples ( 39 )-( 44 ) express such semantic categories as the place where, the time when, the circumstance(s) under which, the manner in which, the reasons because of which, etc., the action expressed by a predicate takes place. Adverbial modifiers functioning at this level (i.e. those which have scope over (the verb in) the core sentence) are often called adjuncts . Adverbial modifiers may also have scope over a constituent only, modifying nouns, attributive modifiers, other adverbial modifiers, etc. (such adverbial modifiers are called subjuncts ): y\u00e9ni \u00fan\u00f3time ve r\u00e1mar aldaron [LotR/377]. Long years numberless as the wings of trees . The prepositional phrase ve r\u00e1mar aldaron modifies \u00fan\u00f3time which itself is an attributive modifier with y\u00e9ni . Some other adverbial modifiers are, syntactically speaking, more detached, and have scope over the sentence as a whole, expressing the attitude of the speaker towards the reality or desirability of the content of his sentence, or his attitude towards the form or style of the sentence (such modifiers are often called disjuncts ): an c\u00e9 mo querne cendele n\u00famenna, ve senya [VT49/22]. For if one turned the face westward, as was usual . The phrase ve senya expresses the speaker's attitude towards the reality of the content of the sentence. Melco mardello lende: m\u00e1rie [ MQ : LR/72]. Melko has gone from Earth: it is good . The idiomatic phrase m\u00e1rie expresses the speaker's attitude towards their utterance. Finally, grammars typically recognize a fourth type of adverbial modifier, that of conjuncts , which indicate how one sentence or larger unit of text relates to its surrounding context,i.e. which play role in structuring a text; such forms are treated in this grammar as connective discourse particles , @@: an Varda maryat ortane ar h\u00edzie unt\u00fapa m\u00edri [LotR/377]. For Varda raised her hands, and mist covers jewels . \u00e1la\u00b7me tula \u00fasactienna mal \u00e1\u00b7me etelecta ulcullo [VT43/12]. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil . Noun Phrases Elements of the Noun Phrase In most of the examples above, constituents take the form of a noun phrase. A noun phrase consists of (at least) a head , and (possibly) various kinds of modifiers which are added to the head. For example, in each of the examples below, a noun phrase serves as object to a predicate: antanen [ hatal head ] object sena [VT49/14]. I cast a spear at him . man [ i\u00b7 modifier yulma head ] object nin enquantuva [LotR/377]. Who will refill a cup for me? h\u00edzie unt\u00fapa [ Calaciryo modifier m\u00edri head ] object [LotR/377]. Mist covers the jewels of Calacirya . Sometimes noun phrase can become quite long and nested: linte modifier yuldar head [ lisse modifier miruv\u00f3reva head ] modifier m\u00ed oromardi And\u00fane pella Vardo nu luini tellumar modifier [LotR/377]. Swift draughts of sweet nectar in the high halls beyond the West under blue domes of Varda . Types of Modifier The following types of modifier agree with the head in number (for the agreement in case, \u2192 27.7 ): numerals : ordinal numerals such as minya first , attea second (for details, \u2192@@); among the ordinals may also be reckoned adjectives such as jana other and ecsa other , enta another , and several others; demonstrative , indefinite , interrogative , and possessive pronouns (for details, \u2192@@): \u00e1vatyara mello [ menye modifier roctar head ] noun phrase [ draft : VT43/11]. Forgive us our trespasses . menye agrees with roctar . quantifiers : certain adjectives indicating quantity, such as n\u00f3tima some , few , ilya every , each : i Eru i or [ ilye modifier mahalmar head ] noun phrase [UT/305].

For the relative ordering of such modifiers, particularly with respect to the article, \u2192@@. Most of these pronouns and adjectives/participles may also have a predicative relationship with a noun, either as predicative complement (\u2192 26.8 above) or as predicative modifier (\u2192 26.22 below). The following types of modifier do not agree with the head: the definite article (for a full treatment, \u2192@@); numerals: cardinal numbers such as min one , atta two (for details, \u2192@@); noun phrases/pronouns in the genitive I very frequently serve as modifier in a noun phrase (for details, \u2192@@): savin [ Elessarno modifier quetie head ] noun phrase [VT49/28]. I believe the words of Aragorn . zindar [ i modifier Eldar head Malariando modifier ] noun phrase [PE21/77]. Grey are the Elves of Beleriand .

Out of a grey country darkness lies . linte yuldar head m\u00ed oromardi modifier [RGEO/58]. Swift draughts in lofty draughts . relative clauses (for a full treatment, @@). Types of Head The head of a noun phrase is typically a noun, such as yulma ; proper names also belong to this class: a aina Mar\u00eda, arca atarme [VT44/12]. Holy Mary, pray for us . Elendil Vorondo voronwe [UT/305]. Of the faith of Elendil the Faithful . Most of the kinds of modifiers listed above (\u2192 26.16-17 ) may also serve as head, however, particularly when they are modified by the article (\u2192@@): adjectives and participles ; sometimes with the article, sometimes with other modifiers as well: a vanima, vanim\u00e1lion nostari [LotR/981]. O beautiful ones, parents of beautiful children . ilyain antalto annar lestanen Il\u00favat\u00e1ren [ MQ : LR/72]. To all they gave in measure the gifts of Il\u00favatar . nactana l\u00f3 T\u00farin [VT49/24]. Slain by Turin . Note If participle had dependent words, the relative clause would be used in its stead: nai tiruvantes i h\u00e1rar mahalmassen mi N\u00famen [UT/305]. May those who sit upon thrones of the West keep watch over it . i carir quettar \u00f3mainen [WJ/391] Those who form words with voices . Assumption attributive genitives , adverbs and prepositional phrases ; always with the article: ral\u00e1'n Ingar\u00e1no'n Ingaranna, mal i\u00b7Eruo'n Erunna Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's . Pronominal and Adnominal Use of Pronouns, Quantifiers and Cardinal Numerals In addition to the types of head treated above, various pronouns and quantifiers and (occasionally) cardinal numerals can serve as head. For these forms, a distinction is made between: the pronominal use , when the pronoun/quantifier serves as head; the adnominal use , when the pronoun/quantifier serves as modifier. In the pronominal use, such forms typically cannot be modified by the article or other modifiers (there are exceptions, however); in other words, such pronouns/quantifiers then function as noun phrases by themselves : lumbule undul\u00e1ve ilye tier [RGEO/59]. Shadow swallowed all roads . Adnominal use. arimelda ilyaron [PE17/57]. Dearest of all . Pronominal use. Note Personal, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns are used only pronominally (\u2192@@). For so-called 'autonomous' relative clauses (i.e. relative clauses serving as noun phrases by themselves), @@. Apposition Apposition is the placement of two words or word groups parallel to each other without any coordinating particle ( ta or ar , @@), with one, the 'appositive' defining or modifying the other. In this way, two noun phrases (each with their own head), may together serve as a single constituent: aistana [ i y\u00e1ve head m\u00f3nalyo ] [ Y\u00e9sus ] head [VT43/31]. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus . The combined phrase i y\u00e1ve m\u00f3nalyo Y\u00e9sus is a subject. [ Elainen head ] [ t\u00e1rin head Periandion ] ar [ meldenya head any\u00e1ran ] [VT49/40]. To Elaine, queen of Hobbits and my very old friend . The whole quote is a combined phrase serving as an indirect object. For agreement in apposition, \u2192 27.15-16 . Predicative Modifiers Some constituents simultaneously serve as adverbial modifier and to modify the head of a noun phrase. Such constituents are called predicative modifiers : they occur in the form of adjectives and especially participles, which agree with their noun in case. For example: ampanaina i\u00b7m\u00e1r ga\u00b7tatallane\u00b7s [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The participle ampanaina agrees with the subject i\u00b7m\u00e1r : it describes the house. At the same time, it serves as an adverbial modifier, describing the circumstances/time of occurence. man hlaruva carcar yarra izilme ilcalasse [MC/222]. Who shall hear the rocks snarling in the moon gleaming? The participle ilcalasse agrees with izilme ; it describes the moon. At the same time, it serves as an adverbial modifier, describing the circumstances/time of rocks\u2019 snarling. Note For this so-called 'circumstantial' use of the participle in, @@. For the position of predicative modifiers relative to their head and the article (if present), \u2192@@. Elements Interrupting or Outside the Syntax of a Sentence Parentheses Sentences may be interrupted by other sentences \u2014 parentheses . These are often relatively short, and frequently contain some form of comment, as in: l\u00e1 caritas, navin , alasaila n\u00e1 [PE22/154]. Not doing this would be, I think, unwise . \u00e1 zac' i\u00b7fende, mecin [PE22/166]. Close the door, please . Elements 'Outside' the Syntax of a Sentence Some elements stand 'outside' the sentence, i.e. they are not part of the syntactic structure of predicates, complements and modifiers. The most important of these are: forms of address (\u2192@@): a Aina Faire, Eru \u00f3rava o\u00b7mess\u00eb [VT44/15]. God, the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us . exclamations , interjections , etc. (also, in answers, n\u00e1 yes ): mal \u00e1\u00b7me etelecta ulcullo: n\u00e1sie [VT43/23]. But deliver us from evil: Amen . Arwen vanimelda, nam\u00e1rie [LotR/352]. Arwen beautiful and beloved, farewell . e man antav\u00e1ro [ MQ : LR/63]. What will he give indeed?

Most of the examples are taken from the Late Quenya corpus, but if the example was adapted from earlier materials, the reference has an additional remark.

Nearly all verbs take at least one obligatory constituent, a subject . Subjects are marked by the common case (\u2192@@), and predicates agree with it in number (\u2192 27.1 ). Some verbs take only a subject: tintilar predicate i\u00b7eleni subject [RGEO/58]. The stars twinkle . i\u00b7arcanwar subject tauvar predicate [PE22/147]. The thrones endure . ulo subject \u00fava predicate [PE22/167]. The rain is coming . Many verbs take both a subject and another obligatory constituent. With a majority of such verbs, this second obligatory constituent is the direct object , which is also marked by the common case (\u2192@@); some verbs take second obligatory constituents in a different case (such constituents are called complements ): Varda subject m\u00e1ryat object ortane predicate [LotR/377]. Varda has uplifted her hands . ilye tier object undul\u00e1ve predicate lumbule subject [LotR/377]. All paths are drowned deep in shadows . ort\u00edrielyanna complement rucimme predicate [VT44/5]. We fly to thy patronage . i\u00b7jarma subject tentane predicate Melcorello object [VT49/7]. The left hand pointed away from Melkor . Some verbs take more than two obligatory constituents: a subject, an object, and one (or more) further complements. Often the third obligatory constituent is the indirect object , which is marked by the dative case (\u2192@@); other verbs take a second complement in the common case: Varda subject enquantuva predicate i\u00b7yulma object nin indirect object [VT49/7]. Varda will fill the cup for me . l\u00e1 navin predicate caritalya\u00b7s object m\u00e1ra complement [PE22/154]. I don't advise you to do so . In the examples above, with one exception, the obligatory constituents are expressed by a noun phrase or a pronoun (these are treated more fully below, \u2192 26.15-20 ). Such obligatory constituents may also take other forms, however. The most important of these are: prepositional phrases (consisting of a preposition and its complement): i subject or ilye mahalmar complement ea predicate [UT/305]. Who is above all thrones . adverbs : lende predicate tanna complement Nieliccilis subject [PE16/96]. Thither came little Ni\u00e9le . subordinate clauses : savin predicate i Elessarno quetie naite object [PE22/158]. I believe that the words of Aragorn are true . The declarative subordinate clause (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate savin : compare Elessar in savin Elessar 'I believe Aragorn' . infinitive constructions : man subject cenuva predicate f\u00e1na cirya c\u00edra object [MC/221]. Who shall see a white ship leave . The common-and-infinitive construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate cenuva : compare and\u00fane in man cenuva m\u00e9tim' and\u00fane? 'Who shall see the last evening?' participle constructions : lie subject tatallaner predicate i\u00b7m\u00e1r ampanaina object [ MQ : PE22/108]. While it was being built people marveled at the house . The common-and-participle construction (\u2192@@) fulfills the role of object with the predicate tatallaner : compare i\u00b7m\u00e1r in tatallanen i\u00b7m\u00e1r 'I marveled at the house' . When a constituent is expressed in the form of a subordinate clause or a construction with an infinitive or participle, this is called a complex sentence . For complex sentences, \u2192@@. Note The number of obligatory constituents that accompany a verb is called the 'valency' of that verb: thus fir\u00eb die has a valency of one, anta give has a valency of three. Some verbs have different valencies in different meanings. For instance, the verb cir\u00eb , when it takes only a subject, means sail , but may also take an object and then means cut . The subject, object and other obligatory constituents that belong to the predicate are also called 'arguments'. The sentence core is also called the 'nucleus' of a sentence. It is sometimes difficult to assess whether a constituent should be considered 'obligatory' in the sense given above (i.e. whether they are required with a predicate to form a grammatically correct core sentence). This is true particularly of adverbial complements such as tanna in (11) , and with verbs which may have different valencies. In reality, syntactic 'obligatoriness' is better seen as a scale, with constituents being more or less obligatory depending on the verb and construction used. There are a few verbs which do not have a subject ('impersonal' verbs, \u2192@@), and very few of these take no other obligatory constituents (i.e. have a valency of zero).

Note how the second sentence has no explicit object, added in the translation ('it') 1 . The lack of an explicit, separately expressed subject is particularly frequent in Quenya, and constitutes a regular feature of the language.

For such 'contrastive' pronouns, \u2192@@.

Linking verbs also occur with an adverbial expression of place or circumstance as their complement: e.g. n\u00e1 be (somewhere), find oneself (somewhere) .
